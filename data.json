Some scholars have argued that opera's evolution toward the age of Verdi and Wagner made Rossini feel increasingly out of date; but there are contrasting indications that the composer's agile intelligence became impatient with operatic conventions old and new.   \"Le Comte Ory,\" Rossini's farewell to comic opera, looks like an old-fashioned buffo romp at first glance, but it has hidden depths and peculiarities. Philip Gossett, America's foremost Rossini scholar, notes its \"sexual and musical shadows, disguises and illusions.\" The plot revolves around Ory's attempted seduction of a Countess whose husband is away at the Crusades; in the final trio, Ory, dressed as a nun, thinks he has embraced the Countess in the dark, only to find that it is his own manservant Isolier (sung by a mezzo-soprano). Avoiding the madcap setting that convention might have demanded, Rossini writes off-kilter and slitheringly chromatic music for this scene; order is restored in the martial finale, but an intriguing tone of decadence lingers.   These reflections are prompted by Tuesday night's smoothly idiomatic rendition of \"Le Comte Ory\" given in concert form by the Opera Francais de New York, at Gould Hall. Yves Abel, the company's director, gave the buffo episodes brilliance and bite, the lyric stretches a spacious eloquence. Since Mr. Abel founded the group in 1988, the Opera Francais has acquired a reputation as a fine independent company; for the most part, this performance did not frustrate expectations.   Jeffrey Francis, a tenor, took the title role's murderously broad range in stride; a nasal edge to his voice enhanced the antiheroic side of Ory's character, although toward the beginning his delivery should have been more seductively fluid. Lauren Flanigan, a soprano, sometimes seemed too powerful as the timid Countess, but her virtuosity drew shouts of praise from the audience. Kristine Jepson was an accomplished Isolier, singing with assurance high into her upper range.   The supporting cast had a couple of weaknesses: Joy Hermalyn did not provide enough contrasting delicacy as the Countess's companion, Ragonde, and the enthusiastic Jan Opalach had moments of wavering intonation as the tutor. But Philip Cokorinos, a bass-baritone, made the most of the opera's comic highlight, Raimbaud's drinking aria. Nathalie Morais, Paul D. Moore and Pierre Lorieau filled out the cast.    The orchestra played with energy and eloquence; there were some odd sounds from the string section, but the wind playing blended elegantly with the voices. The chorus propelled the action handsomely.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930211","headline":"Horse Racing: Notebook; Russ, Aboard 30-1 Shot, Gets Comeback Victory","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/11/sports/horse-racing-notebook-russ-aboard-30-1-shot-gets-comeback-victory.html","abstract":"  Mary Russ, who took six years off from racing to be with her three children, returned last month at the age of 39 and resumed her riding career.

Mr. Kleinsinger, who will celebrate the 20th anniversary of his first Highlights in Jazz concert tonight with a show by the Count Basie Orchestra at the Downtown Theater of Pace University, was a jazz fan stuck right in the middle of jazz's greatest depression. Clubs around the city were folding, mainstream jazz seemed hopelessly traditional to taste-makers, and a new generation of expressionistic musicians had lost the older audience while rock had stolen younger potential listeners. And jazz concerts were a thing of the distant past.   So he decided to put one on.   \"I had gotten to be friends with Bucky Pizzarelli after spending time at Dick Gibson's jazz party in Colorado,\" Mr. Kleinsinger recalled the other day. \"He said to me: 'You know, you're really comfortable with musicians, and you really love the music. You should do a concert.' So I did.\"   The first show, featuring the saxophonists Zoot Sims and Al Cohn, the drummer Bobby Rosengarden, the trumpeter Joe Newman and Mr. Pizzarelli on guitar (Mr. Kleinsinger couldn't afford to rent a piano) was at the Theater de Lys, now the Lucille Lortel, on Christopher Street. The Daily News panned it (\"Jazz at de Lys a Cliched Thing\" ran the headline) and The New York Times praised it (\"Jazz Series Pilot Lifts Fans' Hopes\"). Mr. Kleinsinger never looked back, and 142 concerts later, roughly seven a year, he's still at it, producing the longest-running jazz series New York has ever seen. A Demographic Mix    From the start, he did something unusual. His concerts have been not only racially and sexually mixed, but have also featured performers of widely disparate ages. A typical show might have an octogenarian or two, at least one woman, perhaps a young musician from Germany (looking bewildered), and some be-boppers. Everyone plays \"Sweet Georgia Brown,\" one of the octogenarians sings an obscure pop song and the audience leaves ecstatic.   The concerts are nearly always sold out, and if they aren't the extra tickets are donated to the Harlem School of the Arts and La Guardia High School for the Performing Arts. He has a base audience of 350 who come to every show, and 400 or so more tickets are quickly taken by the 5,000 or so people on his mailing list. Those who come aren't likely to be jazz club habitues. They're often older and have some nostalgic connection with the musicians performing.   \"It's a funny audience in that Doc Cheatham and Milt Hinton would be bigger draws than Wynton Marsalis and Ron Carter,\" Mr. Kleinsinger said. \"For the most part they're people who loved jazz when they were younger and prefer the older forms of jazz, including be-bop. They want to hear songs they know and they like the jam session format. They remember Jazz at the Philharmonic and clubs like Central Plaza, where they'd see guys sitting in.\"   Before and after each show and during the intermission, friends who haven't seen each other for a month hug or shake hands, and chat. The musicians amble around during intermission, and the audience greets them like old friends. 'Celebration of the Mainstream'    For Phil Schaap, a radio disk jockey who spent eight years working the sound system for Mr. Kleinsinger's concerts, each one is a joyful event.   \"It's a monthly celebration of the mainstream,\" he said. \"It's like a clubhouse meeting, and when the meetings are successful, which they always are, everybody reaffirms the deal. The club is Jazz New York and Jack has a chapter of it.\"   The concerts are a way into the past, providing a clue to how jazz used to function as pop culture. \"I'm aware that a lot of people come with a spouse or a date, somebody who isn't a jazz lover and has to be entertained,\" Mr. Kleinsinger said.    But there is nothing condescending about them, either. Mr. Kleinsinger knows which musicians still retain the ability to connect with an audience in a different way, one that mixes the excitement of musical virtuosity with charisma.   \"I was drawn to jazz because the musicians were larger-than-life figures like movies stars,\" he said. \"Satch and Dizzy and Lady Day and others were colorful, vibrant personalities. When you did meet them they rarely let you down. Zoot Sims was exactly how I thought he should be. People like Clark Terry, Dizzy, Milt Hinton, these are great human beings who are gifted entertainers and musicians, all extremely aware of the audience and what the audience needs and deserves.\" A Way of Growing Up    The interest in jazz came early to Mr. Kleinsinger, who at 56 is retired and teaches special courses in law and jazz to seventh graders at Intermediate School 52 in Inwood and spends one day a week working at the Parking Violations Bureau. His cousin, George Kleinsinger, was a composer who wrote \"Tubby the Tuba.\" Mr. Kleinsinger grew up in New York, and as a child he went to the Roxy, the Paramount, the Apollo and other theaters to hear the music.   \"I still have all the records I first bought,\" he said. \"The first one was a Red Norvo 78, featuring Vic Dickenson and Joe Thomas, two of my favorites. The first LP was 'Battle of the Bands,' on Capitol, with Dizzy, and Benny Carter and Charlie Barnett.\"   When he would find himself bored at Newport Jazz Festivals, he would sketch out perfect concert lineups.   The Highlights in Jazz concerts have featured Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz, Milt Hinton, Doc Cheatham, Zoot Sims, Al Cohn, Lionel Hampton, Red Rodney, Dorothy Donegan, Roy Eldridge, Buddy Tate, James Moody, Jimmy Heath, Maxine Sullivan, Hank Jones, Dick Hyman, Marty Napoleon, Vic Dickenson, George Duvivier, Jon Faddis and hundreds of others.   Even when the shows sell out, Mr. Kleinsinger says, they do not pay for themselves. He manages to cover expenses with grant money from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts and by having jazz cruises, jazz brunches and just about anything else with the name jazz in the title.   \"Actually, the beauty of the system is that I don't make a living at it, that I have another means of support,\" Mr. Kleinsinger said. \"We finish in the black, but just barely, with $1,000 or so left over at the end of the year. The musicians play for way below their normal price, and I don't really pay anybody else. But everybody loves it, so I'm going to do it until the day I die.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930211","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/11/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-439793.html","abstract":"  Rosemary Clooney Rainbow and Stars 30 Rockefeller Plaza 65th Floor Through Feb. 27    One word that describes Rosemary Clooney at 64 is balance.

But it doesn't address the question of what to do when a motorized wheelchair short-circuits and catches fire while crossing 34th Street.    What it takes to bring down barriers to the disabled in New York City -- from developing emergency repair service for broken wheelchairs, to revamping subway stations -- gives a glimpse of the broad-scale changes it will take to make the goals of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act a reality. New York's Experience    If history is any guide, the rest of the country will be watching what happens with private and public initiatives here. The Federal law's provisions on access build significantly on New York's experience in the 80's, when the city became a leader in legal action to protect the disabled from discrimination, even using the language of local laws.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930211","headline":"Review/Music; For His Debut Recital, A Pianist Goes Fugal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/11/arts/review-music-for-his-debut-recital-a-pianist-goes-fugal.html","abstract":"  The debut recital of Awadagin Pratt at Alice Tully Hall on Tuesday night was sold out.

At a time when there are few black American classical musicians either onstage or in the audiences of concert halls, this aspect of his curriculum vitae is very relevant to interest in his career.    Mr. Pratt seems well trained: he studied at the University of Illinois and at the Peabody Conservatory, where he was the first student in the conservatory's history to receive diplomas in three performance areas (piano, violin and conducting).

For years, the label Shimmy-Disc has been an outlet for the far side of the New York music scene: bands so experimental they border on surreal, projects so avant-garde they're likely to disturb tame ears. Now, the people at Shimmy-Disc have started a new label, Kokopop, with an esthetic aimed at the more conventional side of the scene. Kokopop is fun; Kokopop is nutty; Kokopop is a word with only three different letters in it; Kokopop will potentially move more product. Tonight's party features five bands, including the jittery, grinding guitar band Jive Bible; Aenone and Dandelion Fire, which tend toward fuzz-based, droning guitar pop; Tiny Lights, veering between progressive-rock jams and dreamy ballads, and the slamming distortion of Morning Glories. Tonight at 9. Tickets are $8. Blues With Heart     Jimmy Dawkins Blues Band, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. The stereotype of the blues guitarist is a guy standing onstage with a pained expression on his face, his hands zooming up and down the neck as he squeezes out notes in a finger-tripping flurry of notes emphasizing flash and technique. Jimmy Dawkins, an unjustly obscure figure from Chicago, works the opposite end of the spectrum. Emotive and economical, he is more likely to turn his back on the crowd and stretch a taut note through several chords, and his solos have a gut-wrenching precision that eschews grandstanding. He resurrects the heart of the blues: its feelings, urgency and ultimate catharsis. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 and 11:30. Tickets are $5. Malone in Overdrive     Michelle Malone, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052. At her best, Michelle Malone is the kind of singer and songwriter who can jolt things into overdrive. Working a raunchy groove that borrows from the Allman Brothers and the Rolling Stones without keeling over into Black Crowes-style mimickry, she can push her band into a jiving, bluesy frenzy that's no less authentic for being derivative. On top of that, she has a wail that could stop an express train.

The most appropriate movie scores for such films are still written in a style that imitates the music of the period, in which the long, tonal musical lines once associated with Romantic desire twist upon themselves, splintering into fragments or drifting into disturbed disarray.    So it should not have been too surprising that when the Canadian director Robert Lepage brought his Canadian Opera Company productions of Bartok's \"Bluebeard's Castle\" and Schoenberg's \"Erwartung\" to the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night, there was no escaping the sense of cinematic cliche. In Mr. Lepage's staging of Schoenberg's monodrama -- a troubled, disoriented monologue by an unnamed woman -- there are languorous slow-motion sequences: an attack with a scythe, a naked body rolling into a stream of water, blood streaming from a corpse, a hand emerging out of a brick wall and grabbing its victim. There is even a white-suited psychiatrist with a pad, making notes as the woman's obsessions take shape. In Bartok's one-act opera, Mr. Lepage has given us a long dungeon corridor, huge doors with keyholes the size of severed heads, shimmering shadows cast by red light and a slow march of women through streams of blood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"Board Splits Are Mirrored In Albany","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/nyregion/board-splits-are-mirrored-in-albany.html","abstract":"  The dismissal of Schools Chancellor Joseph A.

When new fragments of information come out, the papers run them short and inside. The bad Soviets have been replaced by the good Russians, so politicians no longer make self-regarding statements of outrage. Senator Bill Bradley may receive a delegation of seventh graders from New Jersey animated about the issue, but that could have more to do with the electoral value of being nice to kids than with the death in dark waters of 269 innocent people.   It was James Brazell who got the seventh graders interested in Flight 007. His speech to them was the third one on the subject he has given in the last year. As the horror and outrage over Flight 007 fades, the American attachment to the guest speaker, especially free ones like Mr. Brazell, keeps the 58-year-old professor of English plugging away at his lonely cause, which is the appalling conviction that the C.I.A. intentionally guided the Korean passenger airliner off course and over Soviet territory to test the enemy's air-defense reactions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"Woman in the News: CLINTON PICKS MIAMI WOMAN, VETERAN STATE PROSECUTOR, TO BE HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL; Tough 'Front-Line Warrior' Janet Reno","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/us/woman-clinton-picks-miami-woman-veteran-state-prosecutor-be-his-attorney-general.html","abstract":"MIAMI, Feb. 11 As State Attorney for Dade County for 15 years, Janet Reno has grown accustomed to controversy and conflict.

The three-story Nancy and Jake Hamon Building was financed in part by a $20 million gift from Mrs. Hamon, the widow of Jake Hamon, a Dallas oil tycoon who died six years ago. Mrs. Hamon stipulated that the money go toward building a new wing rather than increasing the museum's endowment.   The addition was designed by the New York architect Edward Larrabee Barnes, who designed the museum's existing building in 1984. In addition to office and storage space, the wing provides 14,000 square feet for 7,000 American objects, including the museum's extensive assortment of Pre-Columbian gold. There will also be a 32,000-square-foot education center for the museum, half of whose visitors participate in some kind of educational program.   But with so many museums struggling just to survive, and the city of Dallas's having reduced its financial contributions to the museum, the new wing is viewed with some skepticism in the art world. But there are also those who believe the addition could help pull in potential donors.   \"It may seem brash from a distance but it's the classic Texas attitude,\" said Harry S. Parker 3d, a former director of the Dallas Museum who is now the director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. \"Texas has a long tradition of building real-estate projects on-the-come. And being leveraged is a part of the thinking.\" Against the Tide    Peter C. Marzio, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, said that while most museums were pulling in their horns, Dallas was acting aggressively. \"But sometimes going against the tide works,\" he said. \"The question is do they have sufficient money to operate?\"   Richard Brettell, a former director of the museum who is the consulting director for the Hamon expansion, said he was \"very sanguine about the museum's financial future.\" But he added, \"That's not to say it's going to be easy.\"   When the museum was founded 90 years ago, the city owned all the art as well as the building. When the museum moved to its new site in 1984 it established itself as a separate legal entity. The city of Dallas owns the present museum's buildings and what now amounts to about half its collection. While last year the city cut its funds to the museum by 17 percent, Dr. Brettell said that two years ago the city had extended for 20 years its contract to pay the museum's operating costs based on a percentage of the city-owned art, and that this new contract included the cost of operating the new addition. The city has also agreed to make a one-year increase of 50 percent in its financing to help with the opening year of the new addition.   \"We're building the addition to the city's specifications,\" Dr. Brettell said. \"But the city's collection will remain static and ours is growing, which means that over time the city will be giving less money.\" He said the museum hoped that income from its endowment would be able to cover the difference.  80% of FundsEighty Percent in Hand    The addition is part of a $55 million expansion. Meg Hanlon, who heads the museum's press office, said 80 percent of the funds had been raised.   The wing will become the centerpiece of a totally reorganized museum, housing what the institution calls its Museum of the Americas. In time, the remainder of the collection will be divided among a Museum of Europe, a Museum of African and Asian Art and a Museum of Contemporary Art. The philosophy behind the thematic reorganization reflects the museum's desire to be sensitive to its location, in a state that borders Mexico, and to put non-Western art on an equal footing with European art.   \"When we analyzed the collection we began thinking about making a definition for each building,\" Dr. Brettell said, \"so that rather than simply being a cultural maze, like most museums, ours will be organized into geographical and historical units.\"    On April 17, the institution will reopen a portion of the second and third floors of its existing building to house the Museum of Europe. The Museum of African and Asian Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art are to open in successive years, beginning in 1994. Dispute Over Picasso Print    A lawsuit is proceeding between two of the world's leading print experts: David P. Tunick, a Manhattan dealer, and Eberhard Kornfeld, the owner of Galerie Kornfeld, a well-respected auction house in Bern, Switzerland. Last week, Judge David N. Edelstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan denied a request from Mr. Kornfeld to dismiss the case.   The court had ordered Mr. Kornfeld to produce by Feb. 1 documents relating to the Picasso print that is at the center of the dispute. Mr. Tunick's lawyer, William M. Barron of Walter, Conston, Alexander & Green in Manhattan, said Mr. Kornfeld had failed to do so. Now Judge Edelstein has ordered Mr. Kornfeld to appear in court next week for a deposition.    At the heart of the dispute are issues of authenticity and money. In June 1990, Mr. Tunick paid $1.68 million for an impression of Picasso's famous 1935 print \"The Minotauromachie\" at an auction at Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Mr. Barron says that at the time of the sale both men had agreed that Mr. Tunick would pay for the print in installments. The dealer exhibited the print at the annual Art Show in Manhattan in February 1991, where it was the centerpiece of his booth and was priced at $2 million. The work failed to sell at the show. Offer of an Exchange    Sixteen months after his purchase, and eight months after the Art Show, Mr. Tunick said experts who had seen the signature questioned its authenticity. Mr. Kornfeld, a Picasso expert himself, insists the work is genuine. He offered to exchange it for a copy of the same print in his private collection that had once belonged to Nelson Rockefeller and had for years been on loan to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Mr. Tunick refused to make the swap.   \"He refused the offer when he heard he would have to pay in 30 days,\" said Mr. Kornfeld in a telephone interview earlier this week. \"He said it would not be possible.\"    Last October, nine days after Mr. Tunick said he discovered that the print's signature was fake, he filed suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan, citing fraud, misrepresentation, breach of duty, honesty and good faith in fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty. He asked for his money back -- the $426,254 paid in cash as well as artwork he consigned to the Swiss auction house valued at $974,000 -- and punitive damages of $20 million.   At the end of November, Mr. Kornfeld filed a lawsuit in Switzerland for the money he was still owed. Two months ago the case was thrown out of the Swiss courts on jurisdictional grounds, a decision Mr. Kornfeld is appealing. Change of Venue Denied    Judge Edelstein ruled that the case is to proceed in New York because the disputed print is here, as are the several experts who believe the signature is a forgery. In a pretrial motion, Mr. Kornfeld maintained that the dispute should be heard in Switzerland because he is a Swiss citizen and because his auction house had specified that any court proceedings must take place in Bern. The judge denied the motion to dismiss the case.   Faxes that went back and forth between the two men for 15 months reflect, for the most part, a verbal tug of war concerning the payment. In one fax, dated July 24, 1991, and submitted to the court, Mr. Tunick wrote to Mr. Kornfeld: \"While we see some signs of business beginning to turn around, our cash position remains difficult for now, and we simply are not able to continue with any sort of payment schedule at the moment.\"   Mr. Barron, Mr. Tunick's lawyer, said, \"This was the beginning of the worst part of the recession and Tunick simply could not divert monies and change his business plans to accommodate Kornfeld.\" The lawyer added that \"as of the time David discovered the forgery he had paid $1.4 million in monies and in kind, so that his ability to pay simply cannot be questioned.\"   Mr. Barron said that Mr. Kornfeld changed the terms of the deal, at first agreeing to accept extended payment but then wanting money immediately. A Different Estimate    Matthew C. Kesten, a lawyer with Kantor, Davidoff, Wolfe, Rabbino & Kass in Manhattan, who is representing Mr. Kornfeld, said Mr. Tunick's payments do not add up to $1.4 million. So far, Mr. Tunick has made three cash payments totaling $350,000, according to documents filed with the court. He has also consigned six prints to Mr. Kornfeld to auction, two of which, Mr. Kesten said, have been sold for a total of about $29,000. Mr. Kesten estimates this leaves a balance of $1.3 million.    Among the prints Mr. Tunick sent to Mr. Kornfeld was Edvard Munch's \"Madonna.\" According to court documents, Mr. Kornfeld put the print up for sale and his firm's published sales results indicated that it sold for about $500,000. But after questioning in court, Mr. Kornfeld admitted that the piece had in fact not been sold at all. \"Mr. Kornfeld published the highest bid, he never said the print had sold,\" said Mr. Kesten.   Mr. Barron said: \"Mr. Kornfeld has been struggling to avoid taking the case to trial in New York. He has lost in Bern and here. This case will now proceed with pre-trial discovery and we hope for a prompt trial, where Mr. Tunick will prevail and very likely recover substantial punitive damages.\"    Mr. Kesten sees things differently: \"If we are ultimately allowed by the judge to get to the merits of the case, I think we will be able to show that the signature is correct. The piece was only questioned 16 months after Tunick bought it and conceded that he could not pay for it.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"When Career Women Need to Stop the Clock","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/opinion/l-when-career-women-need-to-stop-the-clock-933593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As the father of a daughter who is a graduate student in psychology, I read Shirley M.

This is an especially good time to consider such an outing, as many schoolchildren start their winter break this weekend and February's crisp temperatures keep the slopes crunchy even when the snow is artificial. Here are two ski areas -- one large, one small -- that make children feel welcome. Vernon Valley-Great Gorge Route 94  McAfee Sussex County  Sussex County  (201) 827-2000 or 827-3900    THE RESORT: Great Gorge came first, in 1965; Vernon Valley, next door, opened in 1967. They merged in 1977 and developed a summer resort called Action Park a year later. With a vertical drop of 1,040 feet, Great Gorge-Vernon Valley has three mountains with 52 interconnecting trails, rated from beginner to expert; 17 lifts, including three rope tows on two bunny slopes; snow-making machines; night skiing; a spa; two base lodges, lodging and restaurants.   THE BUNNY SLOPES: Among very young children, perhaps 3 to 6 years old, the Chicken Little slope is a perfect inducement for the nervous and wary. (The other bunny hill, Lion's Den, is comparable.) Though not too steep, the slope is steep enough for children to be challenged, and it is wide enough to accommodate a large number of skiers with little or no experience. There are two rope tows; when group lessons are taught on one side of the slope, one of the two is shuts down. (Children often think the rope tow is the best part of skiing.) On Sunday, many parents were putting their first-time skiers between their legs and going downhill; others enticed them to ski a few feet into the safety of a parent's arms. Most of the children had no poles, and few were heard whining or crying. They were thrilled.   LESSONS: On holidays and weekends, the resort offers two children's packages for those 3 to 12 years old that offer a blend of skiing and other activities like craft-making and baking. The cost is $32 for a half day or $45 for a full day, including lifts, but equipment rental costs $10 extra. There are also daily group classes whose price ($44 for children 5 years old and up; $51 for adults) includes lift tickets to the beginner slopes and equipment rental.   THE WAIT: We thought we were clever to choose Super Bowl Sunday for an outing, but Vernon Valley was still a popular destination. Waits for some chairlifts lasted about 15 minutes; others were shorter. The rope-tow line at Chicken Little moved quickly when there were no stumbling bodies.   SUSTENANCE: Vernon Valley has three restaurants: one upstairs with views of the mountain, serving fare like chili and burgers; one below, specializing in pizza, video games and adolescents, and one upstairs with a bar and a more sophisticated atmosphere. Smoking is allowed. (There are other restaurants at the Great Gorge area of the resort.)   THE MOOD: This is the Jones Beach of ski resorts; it's not a mecca for the cultural elite and doesn't pretend to be. The surrounding landscape is eclectic, but from the top of the mountain the view is spectacular. It is an easy drive along Route 80 from the New York City area, without too much traffic. The resort attracts a large number of eager beavers, boisterous families and audacious first-timers.   THE COST: Adult lift tickets: $36 for a day (8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.); $26 for a half-day (1 to 5 P.M.); $32 for twilight (3 to 10 P.M.); $26 for night (6 to 10 P.M.); $51 for a learn-to-ski package with limited lift ticket, rentals and group lesson. Children's lift tickets (ages 5 to 12; anyone younger enters free): $29 a day; $22 a half-day; $27 for twilight; $22 for night; $44 for a learn-to-ski package. Rentals: adult skis, boots and poles, $21.50; junior skis, boots and poles, $16.50; snowboards (skateboards without the wheels), $26.50.   HOURS: Mondays through Thursdays, 9 A.M. to 10 P.M.; Fridays, 9 A.M. to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 8:30 A.M. to 11 P.M.; Sundays, 8:30 to 10 P.M. Through March 31. Craigmeur Ski Area Green Pond Road (off Route 23) Newfoundland Morris County (201) 697-4500    THE RESORT: Craigmeur, in rural New Jersey near Stockholm and Lake Telemark, was opened in 1937 by Hugo Muiry, an Austrian immigrant. Devoted to beginners, Craigmeur, with a 300-foot drop, is not ashamed of its small size and mild-mannered slopes. It offers four slopes, three for beginners and one intermediate; a chairlift, T-bar and two rope tows; night skiing, cross-country trails (which may be closed if there is a lack of snow), snow-making machines for the slopes and a cafeteria. Lodging is available nearby.   THE BUNNY SLOPES: On one very wide hill with gentle bumps and relatively stable stretches, lots of parents were towing children downhill by hand, harness or pole. Some parents were on the slope without skis, coaching their children on skis. The two rope tows were not running (the management said it operates them when the slopes become crowded), so the real challenge was riding back up on the T-bar or the chairlift.   LESSONS: The Humpty Dumpty class, for 3-to-6-year-olds, lasts about 45 minutes; the children stretch, bend their knees, ski through a row of poles and learn to stop, all without poles. There was noticeable improvement by the end, and parents had their camcorders running. Humpty Dumpty classes, including equipment rental, lifts and the lesson, cost $20 on weekdays and $28 on weekends. The Ski Eagles class, for children 5 to 12 years old, includes lunch and costs $45 for a full day and $25 for a half day. Rentals are extra: $10 for a full day, $6 for a half-day. Ski Friend is another program, in which parents may hire a teen-ager to ski with a child for $12 an hour.   THE WAIT: Short, although the large number of beginners means there are many brief shutdowns as novices gather themselves up after falling off the T-bar or recover from descending off the chair lift.   SUSTENANCE: The food is acceptable, but you might prefer to pack a picnic lunch. The top-of-the-mountain restaurant has picture windows overlooking the Copperas Mountains and offers a close-up view of people getting off the T-bar (which one child called \"the hook\"). Polyurethaned wooden picnic tables indoors give the restaurant a rustic feeling and make it easy to spend the afternoon reading while others ski. Smoking is allowed.   THE MOOD: Family, family, family. Here parents may rediscover why they had children as everyone basks in the low-key atmosphere, surrounded by other beginners. The resort is not difficult to find driving on Route 80 from the New York City area.   THE COSTS: Full-day lift tickets: $26 for adults; $22 for juniors, children aged 7 to 12; $12 for children 6 and under. Half-day (8:30 to 1 P.M. or 1:30 to 5 P.M.): $20 for adults; $17 for juniors; $12 for children. Twilight (3 to 10 P.M.): $26 for adults; $20 for juniors; $12 for children. Night (5 to 10 P.M.): $20 for adults and juniors; $12 for children. Rental of skis, boots and poles: adults, $17; children 6 and under, $12. Snowboards: $18.   HOURS: Mondays through Fridays, 9 A.M. to 10 P.M.; Saturdays, 8:30 A.M. to 10 P.M.; Sundays, 8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. Through March 31.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"Teacher Is Arrested On Heroin Charge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/nyregion/teacher-is-arrested-on-heroin-charge.html","abstract":"  A fifth-grade teacher in the Bronx who the authorities said would leave work on her lunch break to buy heroin was arrested yesterday on a drug charge.

The evidence was fairly good, especially in piano pieces like \"Vers la Flamme,\" a shuddering little exercise in erotic helplessness in which the circling moth is drawn fatally toward heat and light. Scriabin, thought the Politburo, was hardly music to inspire tool-and-die workers toward new production goals.   Things changed, both in the idea of Scriabin's music and the way it was played. Refiltered through proper channels, pieces like the \"Poem of Ecstasy\" -- which Valery Gergiyev and the New York Philharmonic brought to Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night -- became more like a \"Poem of Youthful Aspiration.\" The tugging, nagging melodic lines, the sensation of ooze, the ecstatic trumpet proclamations suddenly assumed broad shoulders and a squarer cut in performance. Scriabin in his madness thought that if only he skipped and gamboled at a slightly accelerated pace, he would fly through the air.

Most of the works were atonal and rigorously structured, but a few of them showed that the style, for all its intensity, does not preclude humor.   Gunther Schuller's \"Bouquet for Collage\" (1988), which closed the concert, made the best case for the place of levity within the context of concentrated, post-tonal writing. The movements flirt with past styles -- waltzes, ragtime and even a kind of dark, ominous Romanticism -- in an amusing way. But this is a showpiece as well. Scored for flute, clarinet, violin, cello, percussion and piano, it gives each player a moment in the spotlight and demands precision and energy in the connective sections.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930213","headline":"Objets d'Art, Without Hype","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/13/style/IHT-objets-dart-without-hype.html","abstract":"- Far from the world of hype, happy areas of traditional collecting, untouched by speculation, are as thriving as they were two years or 10 years ago.
