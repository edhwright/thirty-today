One of the masters of both forms of conflict was Christoph Willibald Gluck, whose 1779 opera \"Iphigenie en Tauride\" was performed on Wednesday night at the Manhattan School of Music. This production, directed by James Robinson, also yearns to take a role in contemporary debates about operatic presentation, though it does so with far less coherence than did Gluck.    Gluck's impact on the evolution of opera was immense, and he made the issues clear from the very beginning of this elegantly dramatic work. He was opposed to the Italian style in which florid display of a singer's abilities could become an ornament to mythic tales. He wished, in his words, to \"restrict music to its true office of serving poetry by means of expression.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930423","headline":"Editors' Note","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/23/nyregion/editors-note-392093.html","abstract":"  An obituary on Tuesday, and in some editions on Monday, reported the death of South Dakota's Governor, George S.

Not that anyone thinks it's a musical. What the producers (and the performers) want is special dispensation -- either the creation of a new category or a special Tony -- that would make a distinction between the theatrical qualities of \"Fool Moon\" and those of a conventional play or musical.

Only one problem: the food also seemed to have been designed by Martians from a distance. It was great to look at but utterly tasteless.   Now, several visits to E. J.'s make one thing clear: the Martians have learned to cook.   This improvement is not surprising, since E.

Eight years and $6.7 million in the making, the hall brightens the intrinsic attraction of its subject with eye-catching technologies, including holograms, fiber optics and stereo-photographic reproduction of ice-age cave walls, among other things.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930423","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/23/nyregion/no-headline-379393.html","abstract":"  \"To forget would mean to kill the victims a second time.

Proportional representation sounds like the ultimate in democracy -- no voice too small to be heard. But its great defect is that it can spawn too many splinter parties. It tends also to create a permanent class of power brokers, since national parties choose lists of candidates and winners owe nothing to their constituency, providing less accountability than in other systems.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930424","headline":"What About the First Waco Raid?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/24/opinion/what-about-the-first-waco-raid.html","abstract":"  Search warrants and other documents now reveal what Treasury Department officials have denied or obfuscated about the disastrous Federal raids on the Branch Davidian compound outside Waco, Tex.: The first raid, on Feb. 28, was even more misguided than Monday's F.B.I. gas attack.

This comparison, of course, is a tribute to Mr. Seymour's skill. He has taken on a formidable job in his novel, detailing the never-ending fight between the Irish Republican Army and the British forces opposing it.

And I don't think it's as a result of the education system. I'm 19, I just moved into my own apartment, you know.  I'm in school, and I'm happy. I have a job, I'm doing something that I care about. ...     ZAIRE GRAHAM, 17, Bronx (High School of Fashion Industries): I have yet to accomplish success. For me, I'm successful to the point I made it -- to me. My senior year in high school; I can feel that I'm successful that I made it there. And I'm still there for the second term. But I have yet to become successful in my heart . . . because I want my college education. I want this not because society says I need it, but because I want it.      DOUGLAS KILCOMMONS, 17, Staten Island (Tottenville High School): I just want to interject something. I am like so, I am so impressed with like Juan and Bernardo and Zaire and Wubnesh. I am so impressed with you guys. ... In my school the biggest problem with minorities is they always feel like they are like under the gun.      Q    What do you mean by that?     DOUGLAS Under the gun? O.K., well they always feel like they're the ones who are like treated differently. And in some respects that is true, and I agree with that. However, you guys are the success, the minority success story in my mind. Look, all of you expressed today some of the problems that you had earlier, but you helped yourselves. And that's why it impresses me so much. ... And that is what we have to teach everyone to do.  Even white people who are down and out and like, you know, like bums laying on the street.      ZAIRE I don't know if I agree with the student that said that black youths don't focus on education. We must be focusing on education somehow 'cause we've got our black universities filled up with college students.     SUZANNE SCHAMING, 17, Staten Island (Tottenville High School): We have an honors program. And there is one black person I know that is in the honors program.  And I have talked to this girl on many occasions, and, once we had a Harmony Day last year, and she talked to our class.  . . . She constantly gets abuse from black people 'cause she's black and she's in the honors program.

Now, the ninth edition has just arrived in bookstores and libraries, and it contains significant alterations in the numbers for such Hall of Famers as Tris Speaker, Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, and Eddie Collins.\n\nMy purpose here is not to defend \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" or its editorial staff. Nor is it to address the controversial question of whether present-day scoring rules should be applied to earlier eras when different conventions of record keeping prevailed. I simply wish to make an obvious point: Baseball historians should make every reasonable effort to reconstruct the true record of the sport.

Humor, pathos and occasional hyperbole characterize the authors' descriptions of the improvisation and absurdism that were part of everyday life for Jews in the Eastern Europe of the early 20th century. When Yiddish was prohibited on the stage, actors were instructed to ad-lib in a variety of tongues, even in gibberish, if the local secret police arrived. Buloff claims to have introduced the theater of the absurd with his expressionistic production in 1925 of \"Singer of His Sorrows,\" which Eugene Ionesco told Buloff influenced his own anti-naturalistic writing style. The couple made their way to New York in 1927. They appeared with Maurice Schwartz's famous Yiddish Art Theater. They also formed an amateur theater group in Chicago and toured South America. In the 1930's, Buloff made a successful transition into American theater and film, appearing in such Broadway hits as \"Oklahoma!\" and \"My Sister Eileen.\" \"On Stage, Off Stage\" conveys, simply and directly, an engrossing tale.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"That British Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/books/l-that-british-style-039093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In his review of \"Pandaemonium\" (April 4), Stanley Hoffmann argues that I \"confuse nationalism and ethnicity.\" Fair enough.

It was recreated in Dusseldorf in 1987 and in Los Angeles two years ago. The Los Angeles show traveled to Chicago, Washington and Berlin, everywhere provoking discussion.   But the Nazis' attack on the visual arts was just part of their broader assault on modernist culture. In 1938, a lesser-known exhibition in Dusseldorf, \"Degenerate Music,\" gave similar treatment to proscribed composers. That exhibition, too, was recreated 50 years later in Dusseldorf. After traveling to nine other cities in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Holland, it resurfaced in Los Angeles, where it inspired the musical component of the \"Degenerate Art\" show, and at the Bard Music Festival in upstate New York.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"Westbrook, 41, Makes Sure Youth Isn't Served","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/sports/fencing-westbrook-41-makes-sure-youth-isn-t-served.html","abstract":"  The top eight fencers in the men's saber division are so close in point totals, no one wants to go on record to say, even unofficially, which five will make it to the United States world championship team.

But so far, Donnie Sellers says, that has not happened to him. If it did, though, it would be understandable.   That's because Mr. Sellers is living a dual life, working full time as a police officer in Norwalk, as he has for the last 26 years, and serving in the General Assembly in Hartford. In addition, he is serving his second term on the Norwalk Common Council, is in his sixth year as a member of the city's Fair Rent Commission and is in the Army Reserve.   That all leaves Mr. Sellers, 48, with little time for sleep. \"Fortunately I'm able to get by with very little sleep,\" he said in an interview at Norwalk police headquarters. \"I'm also fortunate in that I have a tremendous amount of energy.\"   Mr. Sellers is one of two police officers in the General Assembly. The other, Edwin Garcia, a sergeant in the Hartford Police Deparment, is also a freshman State Representative and, like Mr. Sellers, has to work an all-night shift in order to serve in the legislature.   But, as Mr. Garcia pointed out, \"When I'm at the State Capitol, I'm only five minutes from home and five minutes from work.\" By contrast, Mr. Sellers lives 65 miles from the Capitol and the trip, made almost daily, takes him about an hour and 15 minutes.   Only one other police officer has served in the General Assembly, Joseph Raia of New Britain. A Democrat, as are Mr. Sellers and Mr. Garcia, Mr. Raia served three terms before he was defeated in a primary in his city last May.   Indeed, Mr. Raia let his State Senator know that he supported a bill to permit police officers and other municipal officials to run for office. \"I had wanted to run for the legislature for some time, since I felt that police officers in the state were being treated by the legislature as second-class citizens,\" Mr. Raia said. \"But I couldn't because municipal workers were prohibited from running in Connecticut. So I told State Senator Joe Harper of New Britain that I was all for the bill.\"   The bill passed in October 1984. And two years later, Mr. Raia, who has been a police officer for 23 years, was elected to the General Assembly.  But unlike Mr. Sellers and Mr. Garcia, Mr. Raia took off days without pay when he had to be at the State Capitol. \"It cost me about $10,000 a year, plus about $6,000 in overtime,\" he said. That adds up to $16,000, which is what state legislators are paid, so Mr. Raia, in effect, broke even.   Before running for a vacant seat in the General Assembly in a special election last January, Mr. Sellers sought the advice of Mr. Raia and Mr. Garcia as to the feasibility of being a combination police officer and State Representative. \"They both encouraged me,\" he said with a smile. \"But then they don't live 65 miles from Hartford.\"  A Typical Day    On a typical day, Mr. Sellers, who is divorced and the father of three sons, works from 11 P.M. to 7 A.M. in the complaint bureau of the Norwalk Police Department, then goes home to get a few hours sleep before driving to Hartford. There, he spends up to eight hours attending legislative sessions, public hearings or meetings of the House Education and Labor and Employees Committees of which he is a member. Then Mr. Sellers drives home, catches a few more hours of sleep and is back at his desk in uniform at 11 P.M. \"Fortunately, I often have my days off during the week, which makes it easier for me in Hartford,\" said Mr. Sellers, who won his seat in the special election by a 2-to-1 margin while running with the endorsements of the Democratic Party and A Connecticut Party. \"When I do and I'm tied up late, I often stay over in Hartford with friends.\"   But on other days, neither snow, nor rain nor lack of sleep keeps Mr. Sellers from making his rounds as a state legislator and police officer. For instance, during the March 12 blizzard, Mr. Sellers, rather than drive, took a bus from Norwalk to Hartford because of the storm forecast. Then at the end of his legislative day, he hitched a ride with another Fairfield County legislator in order to get back home in time for the start of his 11 P.M. shift. \"It was kind of a rough day,\" he recalled. \"But everything worked out all right.\" Not to Mention Other Commitments    Still, at times Mr. Sellers has found himself wondering just what in the world he is doing, serving two masters, the legislature and the police department, not to mention his other municipal commitments and the Army Reserves (with whom he spent a recent weekend at Camp Smith, N.Y., near Peekskill).   \"There've been some doubts from time to time, but I'm sure it's going to work out just fine,\" said Mr. Sellers, who has walked a beat, ridden in a radio car and served as a community relations officer since joining the Norwalk Police Department in 1966. \"But I don't think I'm going to seek a third term in the Council this fall and I'll probably resign from the Fair Rent Commission.\"   No one will hold that against Mr. Sellers, whose councilmanic district includes a black and Hispanic section of South Norwalk where he still lives. That is primarily because of Mr. Sellers's popularity and visibility. Over the years, he has made it a point to come to know just about everyone in his neighborhood and, it seems, thousands of other people in Norwalk. Now he is determined to become acquainted with more people in the 140th legislative district, which includes most of South Norwalk but extends as far north as the Merritt Parkway. Directing Traffic With Flair    Given his style, that should not be too difficult. Few, if any, public figures in Norwalk are as recognizable as Mr. Sellers who has a penchant for flamboyant behavior, whether directing traffic or strolling the streets.   The question arises as to how Mr. Sellers got to know so many people in Norwalk. \"It's because I've been a people's kind of cop, and I've always made it a point to reach out,\" he said. \"And I go out of my way to get to know people. I even have my phone number listed, and I always have. Not many cops do.\"   Mr. Sellers's entry into politics came about indirectly. \"I was talking with Nick DePalma, who was then running for mayor as an independent and campaigning in South Norwalk in 1983,\" Mr. Sellers recalled. \"After a while, he said to me, 'Have you ever considered getting into politics?' I told him no, and he said, 'Do you realize people have been honking their horns at you nonstop since we started to talk?' It hadn't even dawned on me.\"   Later that year, Mr. Sellers received the Independent Party's nomination for the Common Council in his district. But no one had bothered to check the Police Department's manual, which then prohibited officers from seeking public office.   \"So I went to Mayor Frank Esposito and asked him if he would please appoint me to some board because I wanted to serve the people,\" Mr. Sellers said. Subsequently, Mr. Esposito appointed Mr. Sellers to the Fair Rent Commission. \"I called the local newspaper about it and had them take my picture and put it in the paper,\" Mr. Sellers said unabashedly. \"I wanted people to know that I was on the commission.\" Critics Take Attendance    In 1989, after the legislature changed the law, Mr. Sellers became the first police officer ever elected to the Norwalk Common Council when, running on the Democratic ticket, he won in a three-way race. \"When I was approached to run, I asked myself, 'Donnie, do you have a future in politics?' And I realized I was a very powerful black candidate. So I thought, go for the gusto. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, and opportunity knocks only once.\"   Mr. Sellers was re-elected to the Common Council in 1991. But since taking his Council seat, he has been criticized, mainly by Republicans, for missing too many committee meetings. Mr. Sellers does not deny that, saying it has been because of other priorities, including his three sons. \"Missing committee meetings hasn't affected my work as a councilman, and I never miss the actual Council meetings,\" he said.   Holding down two jobs is hardly new for Mr. Sellers, who is a graduate of the University of New Haven with a degree in political science. For six years he spent five hours a day teaching troubled middle and high school students in a special program at the Benjamin Franklin School in Norwalk. And during three of those years he also directed traffic outside of Pitney Bowes on Main Avenue in Norwalk from 3 to 6 P.M. five days a week. In addition, Mr. Sellers had started a boxing club for teen-agers and established a youth organization for young people from middle-class neighborhoods.   \"Norwalk's been good to me, and I want to give something back,\" Mr. Sellers said. \"And I think I understand people because I'm a grass-roots type of person. For instance, people in my Council district aren't issue-oriented. But they're petrified because of all of the crime. When they vote, they vote for me, Donnie Sellers, not the issues.\" 'My Own Mother Was Mugged'    Occasionally Mr. Sellers patrols his neighborhood in his car or on foot on his own time, in and out of uniform. It is a low-income area, riddled by drug-trafficking and crime, much of it violent. \"My own mother was mugged in my driveway at 5:30 in the morning as she was walking toward her car to go to work,\" Mr. Sellers said. But he remains upbeat, waving and calling out to residents. \"It's bad, but I do my best to try to make things better.\"   Even one of Mr. Sellers's sons has been scarred by illicit drugs. His son Earl, who is 21, has been arrested several times on drug charges and was shot and wounded in an apparent drug dispute in Stamford last September. He has spent time in prison and at several drug rehabilitation units.   \"I even locked Earl up myself,\" Mr. Sellers said. \"Once, he even stole my gun and sold it to get money for drugs. My reaction to all of that? To get him help. It's a disease.

Jefferson loved classical architecture and did more than anyone else to establish its presence in America -- but he loved imagination, invention and the breaking of rules even more. How was it that a man who disdained dogma could be the moving force behind a style that is the essence of dogma? Go to Monticello and find out.    This is the time to do it, too; in honor of Jefferson's 250th birthday on April 13, more than 150 objects he acquired or had made for his house have been brought back to it. Works of art, artifacts, pieces of furniture, books, maps, scientific instruments and natural history specimens constitute the exhibition \"The Worlds of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello,\" which will remain through December.

Spiritual matters -- ranging from the quasi-metaphysical to old-fashioned biblical sagas -- are surfacing in a burst of screenplays.   The scripts, some of which are destined for television, run from action-adventures to political thrillers to black comedies. Story lines embrace Tibetan monks, faith among Appalachian mountain folk, the Buddha, the Virgin Mary, the Devil, angels and even Jesus Christ. One script circulating centers on Christ's little sister (her name is Ilona, and she's a Mets fan). And in what may be a reaction to the specter of AIDS and the anxieties of life in the 1990's, the apocalypse has also become a popular theme.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"Karen H.

This time he's a lanky Wall Street broker who calls himself Lance, a regular guy with \"a rather extensive background in the area of diplomacy.\"\n\nRachel Swann, the feisty protagonist of \"Temptation,\" Cynthia Blair's latest novel, is not impressed at first.\n\n\"You don't look like a regular guy,\" she says. \"You look like a regular nerd.\"\n\nBut the wine, the rich food and Lance eventually get to Rachel, and she finds it in her soul to take stock of some insider information.\n\nThe rest of the plot, well, it just goes to the devil.\n'Purposely Sarcastic' Book\n\n \"Temptation,\" released this month by Ballantine and chosen for the Doubleday and Literary Guild book clubs, is Ms. Blair's first hard-cover novel, and she will sign copies on Wednesday at 8 P.M. at the opening of a Barnes & Noble bookstore in the Roosevelt Field shopping center.\n\nThe novel, with blurbs from Susan Isaacs and Anne Rivers Siddons, was hailed by Publisher's Weekly as energetic and broadly comic and ingenuously appealing. The jacket describes the book as \"a cautionary fable\" about a woman of the 90's, a single mother who juggles family and career while pursuing a romantic life. \n\nA writer of more than 30 paperbacks, about half for young adults, Ms. Blair, who lives in Sea Cliff, has a witty and irreverent style. \"My editor told me that I'm now considered to be a writer of what is called smart women's fiction,\" she said. \"It's purposely sarcastic. It holds nothing sacred and it has a bite to it.\"\n\nWhen Ms. Blair completed the manuscript two years ago, the character of Rachel was a single woman on her own. But the novelist decided to change her into a divorced, single mother. \"I felt there had to be more at stake, or else she would just seem capricious,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to Lance, the devil appears in the guises of a heavily rouged Avon lady and a callous building superintendent who flicks ashes on the carpet. In one scene the garish cosmetics saleswoman produces a small bottle of the perfume of the month, a Night in Heaven, and liberally sprays it about the room. After becoming overpowered by the horrible smell and feeling \"as if the perfume had invaded every molecule of her body,\" Rachel begins to take the Avon lady, or Auntie Agnes, into her confidence, saying:\n\n\"All my life I've been striving for things. To do things, to accomplish things, to get the things I want. And it's fun to do that, in a way. But at the same time, there's always this frustration. Frustration that comes from the fact that the whole time you're out there, doing your best, knocking yourself out, you're never really certain whether or not you're actually going to get the payoff you so badly want.\"\nUnexpected Turns in Life\n\n Many of her themes, Ms. Blair said, have to do with how people change when life takes unexpected turns.  Though Ms. Blair did not say that she had recently made any pacts with the devil, she bears other similarities to her main character. Like Rachel Swann, Ms. Blair is a writer and a single mother.\n\nAfter earning a B.A. from Bryn Mawr College and an M.B.A. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she began writing part-time while working as a marketing executive. Then she decided to concentrate fully on fiction. \n\n\"When I was in college I purposely suppressed the urge to write because it was such an impractical thing to do,\" recalled Ms. Blair, who grew up in North Babylon.\n\nOne snowy afternoon in Cambridge, Mass., while she was supposed to be writing her business school master's thesis, Ms. Blair was struck with the idea for a novel. In one sitting she wrote 50 pages of what turned out to be her first published book of fiction.\n\nMs. Blair's longtime editor at Ballantine, Pam Strickler, said: \"It was actually 'Close to Home,' the book prior to 'Temptation,' in which she really showed me the kind of writer she'd become. 'Temptation' confirmed it.\"\n\nNarrated in the same dryly observant voice as \"Temptation\" and set in Sea Cliff, \"Close to Home\" chronicles the life of a marketing executive who abandons her career for the rigors of being a full-time mother. The heroine finds juggling Animal Crackers and Legos even more demanding than the stressful pace of corporate life.\n\n\"I like setting reality against absurd situations because that's how life seems to play,\" explained Ms. Blair, who has signed a contract with Ballantine for two more hard-cover novels.\n\nMs. Blair cited a scene in \"Temptation\" when Rachel's boyfriend, Howard, makes a spectacle of himself at a flea market when he jokingly plants a rotating light with a suction cup atop his bald head and cannot remove it.  \"That really happened to my neighbor,\" Ms. Blair said. \"I asked him if I could use it in one of my books.\"\n\nNeither does Ms. Blair hesitate to poke fun at what she called \"the sensitive new-age man, a man who is content to sit on the sidelines and let the woman be the star.\"\n\nOne of Rachel's two sisters is encumbered by such a fellow, who in one scene is thrown into an emotional crisis when there is no unsalted butter in the house. For the sake of the sauce, he immediately rushes out to the store to replenish the supply.\n\nYet amid the humor and satire, Ms. Blair said, one lesson might be encapsulated in the axiom, \"Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.\"\n\n\"What's ironic,\" Ms. Blair added, \"is that one of the things the main character asks for is a boost in her writing career, and this is what this book is doing for me.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"CONNECTICUT GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/connecticut-guide-051493.html","abstract":"  FOCUS ON THE SOUND   The quality of Long Island Sound will be the focus this week of the Junior League of Eastern Fairfield County.

Trade publications for the travel industry responded with editorials and articles pointing to the essential role of travel agents, who now sell 80 to 85 percent of the airline tickets in the United States, a statistic no one disputes. Agents were evidently pained because they believed the article made it appear they were taking juicy commissions, not quite the case in a time of dwindling profits.

As is well known, her persistence opened the floodgates for black American vocal talent, including artists like Leontyne Price, Jessye Norman, George Shirley, Vinson Cole, Kathleen Battle, Betty Allen and Shirley Verrett.   But Anderson's career may be worth considering in the context of the contemporary scene. For as the old racial restrictions have dissolved, the issue of race has actually grown in American consciousness. And for all the success of blacks in the opera house, in other forms of art music black presence is minimal and a cause of anxiety among concert presenters, foundations and political activists. That absence was the subject of a conference last weekend in Winston-Salem, N.C., at which Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto was played by the black nationalist Louis Farrakhan. The more mundane facts: fewer than 2 percent of professional orchestra musicians are black. Classical black instrumentalists can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Black composers of note are still more rare. Only in popular music have black musicians become prominent, even dominant.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"Where Asian Cuisine Can Be Sampled","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/dining-out-where-asian-cuisine-can-be-sampled.html","abstract":"  IN a travel-mad age, Asian Experience in Westport offers diners a quick culinary tour of Asia, a chance to sample dishes that might be found in 10 countries.

Seven weeks after that session, \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\" was the No. 1 hit in the country. And the record, which was to be the only million-selling single of Fitzgerald's career (if you exclude a duet with the Ink Spots), became the biggest hit of 1938.

I had hoped, after some weeks had passed and the smoke had cleared, to discover gems left in the rubble. But it turns out I became increasingly depressed by the exhibition, partly because the few good works in it -- those of Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, Janine Antoni, Kiki Smith, Ida Applebroog, Gary Hill and some others -- are so diminished by the grim circumstances in which they have been placed.

So are the tigers, bears and other animals that fill the 62-acre zoo, which opened recently in Manahat, a valley on the southern outskirts of the city. The new park replaces a cramped facility farther north. Built at a cost of $20.5 million, with much of the money provided by the Tisch family of New York, it does away with cages in favor of more natural surroundings, including waterfalls and ponds dotted with flamingos and swans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"In Zaire, Democracy Seems No Nearer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/opinion/l-in-zaire-democracy-seems-no-nearer-385493.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The crisis in Zaire has become appreciably worse since you reported April 11 (some editions) that the duly elected ministers of Etienne Tshisekedi's Government were prohibited from leaving the country by President Mobutu Sese Seko's troops.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"A sampling of American-run tours and cruises to Indochina","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/travel/a-sampling-of-american-run-tours-and-cruises-to-indochina.html","abstract":"  American tour and cruise operators are responding to the growing tourist industry in Vietnam with a slew of new offerings. Despite current interest by some American veterans of the Vietnam War in returning to the country, the tours do not focus in particular on the war, although many include the Cu Chi tunnels outside Ho Chi Minh City used by the Viet Cong. Most companies will tailor tours to the customers' needs. Many also offer broader tours that include the bordering countries of Laos and Cambodia, although the State Department has recently issued an advisory on Cambodia warning of banditry and sporadic military fighting outside Phnompenh. And the capital itself has seen some violence in the last few weeks. Prices are based on two people sharing a room or cabin. A selective sampling follows.   Absolute Asia, 155 West 68th Street, New York, N.Y. 10023, (800) 736-8187, offers a variety of tours of Vietnam, from the four-day Ho Chi Minh City Stopover, departing daily from Bangkok, which includes two days in Ho Chi Minh City and a day trip to the Cu Chi tunnels in the outlying hills known as the Iron Triangle, because they were so strongly fortified during the war, to the 12-day Vietnam Explorer tour. Departing every day except Monday from Bangkok, it begins in Hanoi and continues on to Danang, Hue, Nahtrang and Dalat, ending in Ho Chi Minh City. The first class Ho Chi Minh City Stopover package price a person is $1,080 to $1,355. The Vietnam Explorer package price is $2,955 to $3,365. Both include air fare from Bangkok. More unusual tours include a 10-day trekking and sailing safari through the central highlands and on the South China Sea ($1,850 a person, air fare from Bangkok not included).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"A Jazz Man Races to Preserve an Era","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/a-jazz-man-races-to-preserve-an-era.html","abstract":"\"LISTEN,\" said Big Bill Bissonnette.
