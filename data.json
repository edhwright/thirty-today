Mexico's economic problems, caused by an abrupt devaluation of the peso by more than 35 percent just three weeks after Mr. Salinas left office, have cast a shadow over his reputation as an economic magician who transformed the country. They also have raised doubts about whether the economic reforms during the six years of his administration were really as successful as they had been portrayed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950109","headline":"Seeking a Place in the Sun for Mondrian","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/arts/seeking-a-place-in-the-sun-for-mondrian.html","abstract":"  For all of Piet Mondrian's influence over postwar art, architecture, design and printing, the organizers of a major retrospective of his works here seem strangely defensive about this reclusive Dutch abstract painter and his place in the history of art.

Mr. Yeltsin's mishandling of the Chechen rebellion is sure to strengthen those who want to end American assistance and return to a strategy of containing rather than befriending Russia. That would be a mistake, but some recalibration of long-term American policy is warranted.   Recognizing that the brutality of the attack has undermined Mr. Yeltsin, President Clinton has urged him to end the killing of civilians and accept an offer from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to help mediate a political settlement. Moscow should not refuse. Belatedly, Mr. Yeltsin says he is trying to put the military on a tighter leash and end the indiscriminate bombing of Grozny, the Chechen capital. Unfortunately, the army's sledgehammer approach has already dishonored the important principle that Moscow has a right to maintain the cohesion of the Russian federation, and in extreme cases like Chechnya, may use limited military force.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950109","headline":"What That Gingrich Tribute to the Democrats Really Meant","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/opinion/l-what-that-gingrich-tribute-to-the-democrats-really-meant-215795.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   So even you are taken in by the \"magnanimity\" of House Speaker Newt Gingrich in throwing bouquets to the Democrats in his inaugural speech (\"The Gingrich Paradox,\" editorial, Jan. 5).

One victim, Robert M.

The convening of the 104th Congress last week appears to have accelerated the phenomenon of electronic democracy, which has been spreading along with the personal computer.    Electronic democracy is far from perfectly democratic, given the high relative cost of computer equipment, phone service and information fees. Recent demographic surveys of the Internet reveal an electronic citizenry that is predominantly white, male, educated and well to do. But there are countless resources available to those who want to make the effort to keep tabs on the new Congress, a new Governor or a new City Council.

That estimate was longer than the five years or less forecast recently by some senior American and Israeli officials, who said the fundamentalist Islamic Government in Teheran was closer to producing nuclear weapons than previously believed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950110","headline":"Cultural Groups Mobilize To Take On the New Congress","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/10/arts/cultural-groups-mobilize-to-take-on-the-new-congress.html","abstract":"  Alarmed by growing attacks on Federal support for the arts, cultural groups around the country are mobilizing to press their case directly to the avowedly hostile House Republican leadership.

There is none. Yet in every decade since the 1950's, throngs of foreign-policy experts have asserted that NATO faced some new crisis. Now comes the crisis of the 90's -- the fragility of democracy in Eastern Europe and Russia, and the loss of a common enemy -- and therefore, it is said, NATO must admit Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and other nations of the former Warsaw Pact. This remedy may seem all the more urgent as Russian forces keep inflicting wanton destruction on Chechnya.   Americans who question the wisdom of this eastward expansion fear that it might cause Russia to refurbish its military and expand westward. But this is only half the problem. Far from solving an alleged crisis, expanding NATO now would fatally weaken it. The Atlantic alliance must not become a chain letter -- some Ponzi scheme that escapes bankruptcy only by signing up new members.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950111","headline":"Developments in Congress","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/us/the-104th-congress-diary-developments-in-congress.html","abstract":"  HOUSE -- Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve Board, offered Republicans a painless way to cut the budget: changing the way the Government calculates inflation.

World War II and 50 years of Japanese protectionism reduced that to zero, but Ford is now spearheading a resurgence of U.S. car sales in Japan. Ford boosted its Japan sales by 198 percent this year by improving quality, acquiring 300 showrooms, letting Japanese auto writers drive across America in a Taurus and even sponsoring the Hiroshima professional soccer team, which won the national championship with the Ford logo on its jerseys. Last year Ford sold out its allotment of Mustangs for Japan in two months.   This is not a Ford commercial. But the Ford example is worth highlighting because it comes at a time when so many other U.S. businesses are giving up on Japan, saying that it is just too expensive and aggravating to keep trying to break into the closed Japanese market. Better, they argue, to focus sales -- and U.S. trade diplomacy -- on more open emerging markets in Indonesia, Malaysia, China and India.

Mr. Vallone wants the central Board of Education expanded from seven to nine members, with the Council picking the extra two members. That would only worsen the existing clutter of appointing powers.   Each of the five borough presidents now appoints one member, and the mayor appoints two. It is a formula for diffuse authority and little accountability. This page has long advocated giving the mayor, who is responsible to voters, more control over the board through additional appointments. It makes little sense to further fragment the board by inserting the City Council. Any change in the board would have to be approved by the State Legislature.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950111","headline":"Italian Leaders Still Wrestling Coalition Crisis","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/world/italian-leaders-still-wrestling-coalition-crisis.html","abstract":"  Three weeks after the resignation of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Italian leaders this week are inching toward a formula for an interim government to lead the country out of its political stalemate.   But even the appointment of a new Prime Minister-designate, which is expected to be announced by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro before the week is out, is unlikely to put an end to a crisis that has already taken its toll on financial markets and led to a further weakening of the Italian lira.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950111","headline":"Changed Man or Not, Tom Snyder's on Late","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/arts/television-review-changed-man-or-not-tom-snyder-s-on-late.html","abstract":"  In the 1970's, there were a couple of guys who turned traditional talk-show etiquette on its head. One was Stanley Siegal. The other was Tom Snyder, who, as it happens, has had his subsequently flagging career gloriously revived. Coming off a talk series on CNBC, he is now the host of CBS's new \"Late Late Show\" immediately after David Letterman, who years ago replaced Mr. Snyder in the slot immediately after Johnny Carson. Ain't show business grand?    Mr. Snyder returns amid much palaver that he is a changed man, someone who realizes that, hey, it's just a job, not a life. He is supposedly less brash. But Mr. Snyder has always been less brash than goofy, unable to resist an off-the-wall insight, usually accompanied by his own delighted laugh. Happily, he hasn't changed much. He's grayer and even a bit thinner but still unexpectedly prickly. His first anecdote on his first CBS show was about a broadcast-center security guard who had the nerve not to recognize him. Then he took a swipe at Mr. Carson, who, unlike Mr. Letterman on Monday night, never plugged his show in all their years at NBC.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950111","headline":"Gingrich Knew of Comment By Historian, Her Aide Says","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/us/104th-congress-speaker-gingrich-knew-comment-historian-her-aide-says.html","abstract":"  Speaker Newt Gingrich, who dismissed the House historian on Monday over her comments about an educational program on the Holocaust, knew about those statements before he hired her, an assistant to the former historian said today.

Mrs. Whitman also beat a temporary retreat on her vaunted school voucher plan for Jersey City by postponing for another year the measure, which had been meeting increasing resistance among legislators. The Governor appointed a study team to examine the idea until next year, when, she promised, she will move ahead with the program to give parents a free, subsidized choice of public or private schools in the city.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950111","headline":"Duke and Ament Receive '94 Honors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/sports/sports-people-bowling-duke-and-ament-receive-94-honors.html","abstract":"  NORM DUKE, 30 of Edmond, Okla., and TONY AMENT, 25, of Garfield, N.J., were the big winners yesterday as the Professional Bowlers Association announced its awards for the 1994 player and rookie of the year respectively.
