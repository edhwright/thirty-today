As the German composer stood gazing out over the spectacular prospect, a loudspeaker attached to a pole next to him issued \"Tristan und Isolde.\" The idea made perfect sense to those who thought it up. Take a feast for the eyes; increase it with a feast for the ears. More art adds to one's enlightenment just as more money adds to one's bank account.   This grand old American tradition of power through increase has evidently traveled far. The Bochum Symphony and its theatrical partner in this venture, the Dusseldorf Schauspielhaus, brought it with them in three performances of Schoenberg's \"Jacob's Ladder\" and Bernd Alois Zimmermann's \"Turning, I Saw Great Injustice\" at the Long Beach Opera this weekend.

United Nations officials here clustered around a high-frequency radio throughout the day for bulletins from the convoy leader, who eventually abandoned his efforts to persuade Serbian commanders to let the relief vehicles pass. For a third night, the vehicles pulled back from the Serbian roadblock at Mali Zvornik, on the Serbian side of the border between Serbia and Bosnia, and bivouacked for the night.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930217","headline":"Reds' Roberts Awarded $3.9 Million Contract","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/17/sports/sports-people-baseball-reds-roberts-awarded-3.9-million-contract.html","abstract":"  BIP ROBERTS, a second baseman who started games at three other positions for Cincinnati last season while batting .323, was a winner in arbitration yesterday.

With Cincinnati, Roberts started games in left field and center field, and at second base and third base, and committed only seven errors.

The case simmered throughout the 1930's, and its underlying tensions are still very much with us. Edgar Nkosi White, a playwright, and Genji Ito, a composer, have built a stylized blues opera from the basic facts of the case.   The plot focuses on Clarence Norris, \"last of the Scottsboro boys,\" who lived to be pardoned by Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in 1976. He is represented as a naive, wayward soul who leaves his mother and girlfriend to find work. Thrown summarily into prison, he finds himself the victim of racial hatred. He is about to be lynched when Samuel Leibowitz, constantly referred to as \"a lawyer from New York City,\" arrives on the scene. Leibowitz's defense fails, and Norris breaks out of prison rather than face a death sentence. He finds his girlfriend, Donna Lee, shows up at Leibowitz's apartment in New York and is directed to a hiding place in Harlem. The police recapture him and return him to Alabama. In a vibrant gospel epilogue, he is shown being pardoned by the villainous sheriff, who is seated in Wallace's wheelchair.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930217","headline":"Brazilian Sequel: A Jailbreak, a Bitter Widow","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/17/world/brazilian-sequel-a-jailbreak-a-bitter-widow.html","abstract":"  With the killers of Francisco (Chico) Mendes apparently on the run in Bolivia, the widow of Brazil's slain Amazon defender asserted today that the authorities had ignored repeated warnings that security was dangerously lax at the Amazon jail.   \"The authorities knew about the conditions, but they didn't take any measures,\" the widow, Ilzamar Gadelha Mendes, said in a telephone interview from Xapuri, an Amazon town 2,500 miles northwest of here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930217","headline":"2 New Studies Link Vasectomy To Higher Prostate Cancer Risk","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/17/health/2-new-studies-link-vasectomy-to-higher-prostate-cancer-risk.html","abstract":"  Two large new studies being reported on Wednesday add to earlier evidence that a vasectomy may increase a man's risk of developing prostate cancer.

So far, Mr. Clinton has kept international issues at arm's length, at least publicly.
