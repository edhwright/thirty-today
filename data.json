But this mundane three-year visit by the Czech composer has begun to take on epic proportions, partly because Dvorak came here with advice: that American music find inspiration in such folk sources as Negro and Indian songs. His advice brings up issues that now cause anxious debate: What relationship does high art have to popular culture? How should music evolve in a country that has no coherent national culture?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931109","headline":"Supreme Court Roundup; Justices Agree to Rule on Rights of State Prisoners","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/09/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-agree-to-rule-on-rights-of-state-prisoners.html","abstract":"  Opening a new round in its long-running debate over the right of inmates in state prisons to have their cases reviewed in Federal court, the Supreme Court today agreed to decide whether inmates transferred from one state prison system to another can appeal to Federal court on the ground that their confinement violates the interstate agreement on prison transfers.   Under an agreement signed by 48 states -- all except Louisiana and Mississippi -- and the Federal Government, a complex set of rules governs the handling of prisoners who face criminal charges in more than one jurisdiction. A prisoner who is transferred for trial in a different state must be tried there within 120 days, or the charges must be dismissed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931109","headline":"Theater in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/09/theater/theater-in-review-384593.html","abstract":"  Trophies  Cherry Lane Theater 38 Commerce Street Greenwich Village By John J.

It crosses the river Neretva and connects the two parts of the city, which is named after the bridge keepers (mostari) who guarded the Stari Most during the Ottoman era. On 9 November 1993, Stari Most collapsed due to shelling by the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), since the bridge was a military target as the opposing Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina used it as a military supply line during the Croat–Bosniak War. Subsequently, a project was set in motion to reconstruct it; the rebuilt bridge opened on 23 July 2004.

At the Academy on Thursday night, in a College Media Journal Marathon show, Ms. Napolitano's voice and her premeditated but unforced gestures filled her songs with drama.    In long, sweeping crescendos, her voice kept finding new reserves of power; then, suddenly, she would drop to a confidential purr and start again. At a time when rockers are often flippant and self-deprecating, she sings as if personal crises and triumphs can shake the world.

There is something poignant as well as ridiculous in the sight of the fleshy comic performer making a deliberate fool of himself while executing a narcissistic model's poses for Vogue. Especially in those moments featuring Mr. Rohou, \"Les Incroyables\" is more than just entertaining: it feels liberating.   \"Les Incroyables,\" which is attracting a growing cult audience in the SoHo supper club Kaptain Banana (101 Greene Street), isn't always so amusing. But the show, which is mostly lip-synced to blaring pop music, is performed at such a breathless pace that there is little room for contemplation. Featuring eight dancers and three drag performers drawn from the Parisian cabaret world, it offers a distinctly European view of American pop culture. In parodying American pop sounds and images that run from Donna Summer to Michael Jackson to John Philip Sousa, it fits everything comfortably into a French music-hall tradition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931111","headline":"Slain Taxi Driver Knew Danger but Drove On","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/11/nyregion/slain-taxi-driver-knew-danger-but-drove-on.html","abstract":"  If Sindulfo Perez ever felt invulnerable to the dangers of the taxi business, his fellow livery drivers were frightful reminders.

This Los Angeles singer and songwriter, who on Tuesday evening gave the first of his three concerts this week at the Nederlander Theater in Manhattan, has just released \"I'm Alive\" (Elektra), a recording of searching personal love songs that are very close in style and feeling to those on his 1974 album, \"Late for the Sky.\" And on Tuesday, the 45-year-old singer, who seems hardly to have aged over two decades, performed a brilliant, low-key concert in which the artistic powers that seemed to be deserting him during much of the 1980's were back in full force.   Mr. Browne developed his reputation in the early 1970's as a folk-rock songwriter with a singular gift for describing the emotional landscapes of intimate relationships. In language that was direct but slightly elevated, he distilled a vision that linked his faith in an idealized romantic love with the utopian post-hippie ethos of the period. That vision had its dark side. Songs like \"Before the Deluge\" and \"The Pretender,\" which he performed on Tuesday, foresaw the dissolution of those dreams and envisaged a day of reckoning.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931111","headline":"New World Order : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/11/opinion/IHT-new-world-order-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Nov. 11 marks the 75th anniversary of Armistice Day, the conclusion of the \"War to End All Wars.\" Instead, World War I marked the beginning of increasingly brutal conflicts in which civilians became the prime targets, with the bombing and shell","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931111","headline":"The Way to Go : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/11/opinion/IHT-the-way-to-go-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"25 Years Later, Sailing Across the Atlantic Isn't What it Used to Be\" (Leisure, Oct. 22)by Martha Pichey: .The author obscures the wonderful aspects of traveling by sea, and indeed, misses the whole point.

Its first New York concert of the season, called Concertante, offered mostly works that edged beyond the chamber-music notion of all parts being equal and flirted with the concerto form. In selections from Francois Couperin's \"Pieces en Concert\" this was accomplished editorially: the original wind, string and harpsichord texture was transferred by Paul Bazelaire to solo cello, string quartet and bass. That's a big leap, and the performance on Saturday had the kind of lush, vibrato-laden sound of 1950's-vintage readings of Baroque music.

In short order, it was revised and expanded, turning into the sort of unpretentious, inexpensively mounted musical that relied mostly on its infectious melodies and young, enthusiastic casts.
