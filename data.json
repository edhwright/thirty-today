There is general excitement without hysteria and plenty of credible action.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"Clintons Plan to Attend Burial Service for Onassis","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/nyregion/clintons-plan-to-attend-burial-service-for-onassis.html","abstract":"President Clinton will speak at a graveside service for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis tomorrow afternoon at Arlington National Cemetery, the White House said yesterday, and Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend the funeral Mass tomorrow morning in Manhattan.

To the playwright, an exile in his own country, the woman he never knew was a living portrait of the artist as an outsider and a powerful symbol of his own ambivalence.

The Romantics saw him as a kindred spirit, which he was. Then the Realists adopted him as Everyman's champion, which he was, too, up to a point. The Symbolists embraced him. The Surrealists claimed him for obvious reasons, the Existentialists for less obvious ones, even the fascist Franco because Goya was Spanish and patriotic and the servant to a succession of rulers. Most recently, a major traveling exhibition in 1989 served up Goya the liberal, a figure more in tune with post-Franco Spain.   Goya is too complex an artist to fit neatly into any of these slots, and it comes almost as a relief that \"Goya: Truth and Fantasy,\" here at the Royal Academy, doesn't try. It celebrates him simply as a brilliant painter. The show, organized by Norman Rosenthal of the Academy, Manuela Mena Marquez of the Prado and the Goya scholar Juliet Wilson-Bareau, is one of the most pleasurable exhibitions in a long time.

Both open at 9 A.M., when the sun is relatively low in the sky and the pelicans are diving offshore. Each fort has a small museum, with maps, models of ships and exhibits on military life, but the displays can't compete with the forts themselves: sprawling moated labyrinths, with limestone walls 18 feet thick and as many as six tiers of cannons pointed out to sea.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"Brave New World","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/travel/l-brave-new-world-121380.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Thanks for the funny article by Melvin Landsberg about the airlines taking over the Postal Service (\"Brave New World,\" April 3).

And some of the programming for this season is appealing: Joshua Rifkin conducts Bach's B-minor Mass, Gerard Schwarz leads Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and performers include Hans Vonk, Vladimir Feltsman, Martha Argerich, Hermann Prey and Shura Cherkassky.   But since 1992, the festival has been operating under a shadow of Mozart-weariness. That summer, a year after its triumphant 25th anniversary, Mostly Mozart seemed a desultory affair, sweeping up crumbs left by Lincoln Center's 19-month commemoration of the bicentennial of the composer's death. Both festivals were heartily attacked in these pages for their lack of imagination. And last summer, the less effective programs were taken as further evidence of sclerosis.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"LONG ISLAND JOURNAL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/nyregion/long-island-journal-141798.html","abstract":"  Faith in Snowballs    SOMETIME, somewhere, in the history of Stuart Himmelfarb, something turned him from an average child who loves snow into a person who views falling white crystals as a historic event.

He specifically wanted to get tough with loggers, ranchers and miners who, encouraged by generous subsidies, a pliant Congress and a captive bureaucracy, had been allowed to develop the West without paying fair prices or giving much thought to environmental values.   In the last year, Mr. Babbitt has suffered disappointments. His proposal to reduce subsidized logging in national parks was torpedoed by the White House during the 1993 budget battle after complaints from Western Democratic senators.

The subtitle is misleading: Robert Emmet Long's sensible text briefly summarizes and analyzes every film Mr. Bergman has written or directed, but only those stage productions that have traveled to New York in recent years receive more than a polite nod. The book contains plenty of shots of Mr. Bergman at work, though most of the more than 200 photographs are taken from his movies. \"Fanny and Alexander\" and \"The Magic Flute\" are amply illustrated, in color as well as in black and white, while masterpieces like \"Winter Light\" and \"The Passion of Anna\" are slighted. There is a splendid two-page reproduction of the dance of death from \"The Seventh Seal,\" yet turn the page to \"Wild Strawberries\" and you won't find a single image from the opening dream sequence. \"Now About These Women,\" which Mr. Long says \"is commonly considered Bergman's worst film,\" gets more picture space than \"Persona,\" which is possibly his best. The captions are occasionally instructive and occasionally erroneous (if that's Erland Josephson on page 119, I'm August Strindberg). Mr. Long, the author of \"The Films of Merchant Ivory,\" writes about Mr. Bergman's \"intense preoccupation with women, perceived with a ripe sensuousness.\" Thus it is no surprise that the stars of this book are remarkable actresses like Liv Ullmann and the magnificent Anderssons, Harriet and Bibi.

For the third year in a row, however, the last concert, at 7 this evening in the Westport Arts Center, is symphonic, with Glen Cortese conducting the Manhattan Chamber Orchestra in Brahms's \"Academic Festival Overture\" and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"SOAPBOX;\nPolitics vs. Conscience","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/nyregion/soapbox-politics-vs-conscience.html","abstract":"WHEN I was appointed to Community Board 3 on the Lower East Side two years ago, the closest I'd ever been to public office was as president of my sophomore high school class.

He should face up to the reality that these conditions have not been met and propose targeted economic sanctions to Congress. These should be designed to send a strong political message while limiting the economic damage to both sides. Some damage is inevitable, but it is a cost worth paying for principle and consistency.    Chinese leaders plead that this has been a difficult year -- uncertainty over who will succeed Deng Xiaoping, problems with economic reform, inflation, new pressures for democracy, peasant and labor unrest. They ask the U.S. to suspend its human rights concerns and accept repression for the sake of stability and growth.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"A Switch for Rahal and Groff","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/sports/auto-racing-a-switch-for-rahal-and-groff.html","abstract":"  Bobby Rahal and his teammate, Mike Groff, were out-run in the last 20 minutes of qualifying today at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, but quickly re-qualified in faster cars.

By fall, construction is expected to begin on the project's first building, a 39-story apartment building designed by Cesar Pelli. A lot of planning has gone into this $2.3 billion project, and it has produced some excellent features. With the river at its doorstep, the Manhattan skyline for a backdrop and Grand Central Terminal just one subway stop away, Queens West is shaping up to be a wonderful place to live.   But for those concerned about the vitality of architecture in New York, Queens West may turn out to be a disturbing place to visit. Like Battery Park City, the project provides a framework in which individual buildings can be joined together in a cohesive urban whole. What it has yet to do is address one of Battery Park City's most conspicuous shortcomings: its failure to nurture the architectural creativity that could bring the urban whole to life. The shortcoming is not limited to Battery Park City. New York has seen few buildings of genuine distinction arise in recent years. The issue raised by Queens West is whether the public sector has a responsibility to revive an art form that has languished in historical pastiche.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"New Haven Prepares for 6,500 Athletes and 500,000 Spectators","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/nyregion/new-haven-prepares-for-6500-athletes-and-500000-spectators.html","abstract":"  THE 1995 Special Olympics World Games are more than a year away, but at the games headquarters in New Haven activity is already heating up.

After Greco qualified, Herta, Foyt's rookie driver, was the top man on the bump list as the slowest remaining car. Geoff Brabham then called off his run after three laps because he was going too slow. Mark Smith then spun and crashed in the first turn of his first lap. Gary Bettenhausen then ran two laps but called off the run as too slow. At that point, Foyt could have sent Herta out in a faster spare car, but he thought that Willy T.

Peter Scholes's overwrought score, larded with excerpts from Donizetti's \"Forza del Destino\" coats the proceedings with a thick quasi-operatic gloss.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940523","headline":"Clinton and California: An Economic Policy Clash","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/23/us/clinton-and-california-an-economic-policy-clash.html","abstract":"  In 1992, the motto of the Clinton campaign was: \"It's the economy, stupid.\" For the White House aides counting electoral votes for 1996, the theme is: \"It's California, stupid.\"   Those two goals collided on Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the fourth time this year, seeking to brake the national economy before its recovery gets too strong and leads to inflation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940523","headline":"Yanks See Relief Just A Dugout Away","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/23/sports/baseball-yanks-see-relief-just-a-dugout-away.html","abstract":"  Sometimes all the hours of preparation, all the careful study and all the maneuvering with a rested bullpen can still leave you precisely where you don't want to be.

Sludge disposal became more costly after the federal ban on ocean dumping. Since the creation of the Water Finance Authority, which issues bonds, and the Water Board, which sets rates, the city's water system has depended on user fees rather than tax subsidies. The city is now in the first year of a planned two-year rate freeze. To avoid future rate hikes, the city hopes to encourage conservation and continue to meet EPA guidelines without having to filter all its drinking water.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940523","headline":"1919: Red Plot Reported : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/23/opinion/IHT-1919-red-plot-reported-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - The air has been full of reports, for the last few weeks, of a Bolshevist coup in England along an altogether new line.

About half of Mr. Clinton's in-patient Medicare cuts would come from hospitals that train doctors and hospitals that serve indigent communities. New York hospitals do a lot of both: they account for 5 percent of national in-patient Medicare expenditures, and about 15 percent of Medicare's contributions toward medical training and indigent care.

But unlike recent massacres in Rwanda, it caused no international outcry, no calls for military intervention by the United Nations. One reason for the different response is that Indonesia is a big and powerful Islamic country, a leader of the nonaligned bloc, yet also a lucrative market for Europe and the United States. And Jakarta has few scruples about using its muscle.   This has been confirmed afresh by Indonesia's crude pressure on President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines to censor a human rights conference in Manila scheduled to begin next Tuesday, at which eight exiled East Timorese activists were invited to speak. When Indonesia's military regime learned of this, it warned that unless the conference was canceled, Indonesia would probably refuse to be host to peace talks between the Philippine Government and Muslim separatist rebels.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940524","headline":"DEATH OF A FIRST LADY: The Overview; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Is Buried","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/us/death-of-a-first-lady-the-overview-jacqueline-kennedy-onassis-is-buried.html","abstract":"  Eulogized by President Clinton as a \"remarkable woman whose life will forever glow in the lives of her fellow Americans,\" Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was buried today on an Arlington hillside next to her martyred first husband, the 35th President of the United States.

Tony Marsico kept his bass to a minimal throb. The restrained music pressed at the seams of each song, threatening to burst into abrasive noise at any moment. This tension heightened the effect of \"Someone to Pull the Trigger\" and \"Devil With the Green Eyes,\" songs delivered from the point of view of someone two steps from the edge.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940524","headline":"WHITE HOUSE GETS PROGRESS REPORT ON RIGHTS IN CHINA","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/world/white-house-gets-progress-report-on-rights-in-china.html","abstract":"  After months of debate over linking China's human rights performance to its trade privileges, Secretary of State Warren Christopher today offered President Clinton an accounting of China's record that effectively provided the legal argument for renewing the trade benefits, senior Administration officials said today.   Mr. Clinton, in an executive order last year, spelled out the human- rights conditions for the renewal, two of which are mandatory. Mr. Christopher told the President today that China had met those two requirements: cooperation on ending the export of prison-made goods to the United States and allowing close family members of certain dissidents to leave the country.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940524","headline":"With a Little Practice, Gooden Looking Good","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/sports/baseball-with-a-little-practice-gooden-looking-good.html","abstract":"  Dwight Gooden was fluid on the mound tonight and he even added a run-scoring single to his night's work.
