True, the vase paintings are linear compositions using a limited range of colors, and so are the modern drawings. But the concentric circles in the 1969 Louise Bourgeois have only a distant relation to the geometric decoration on a circular pyxis, or lidded box. The German art historian Alois Riegl may have argued for the priority of abstraction over realism in the evolution of the ornamental tendril; nonetheless, the loopy shapes in Brice Marden's etching \"After Botticelli 4\" don't look anything like the vine leaves on the nearby calyx-krater, or wine vessel. Nor do the leaves in the 1949 Matisse resemble those on the tiny cuplike skyphos next to it. (The owl on another skyphos does look a lot like the owls on Picasso's 1950-51 ceramics, but Picasso's ceramics are not in the show.)

Such classics as \"The Fox and the Raven\" and \"The Cricket and the Ant\" were our equivalents of Winnie the Pooh and Mother Goose: the earliest tales with which we were read to sleep, the first verses we read and recited in school. The obligation to memorize La Fontaine's poems, made all the more enticing by Grandville's illustrations of woodland creatures in hilariously formal antique garb, never lay heavily on us. It was, in fact, a source of constant delight because these fables embodied the rhetorical device to which children are most drawn: the attribution of human thought and discourse to members of the animal kingdom.   But La Fontaine's cautionary verses, the theme of a beautiful little show at the New York Public Library, stamped our consciousness far more deeply than Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail affected children of the English-speaking world. They were composed according to the central agenda of 17th-century French literature -- \"To Please and to Instruct\" -- and instruct they did, relentlessly. Continually cited in the classroom or at the family dinner table, they became a code of conduct, a delectably ironic secular catechism programmed toward character building and self-improvement.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950217","headline":"The Fear of Growth : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/opinion/IHT-the-fear-of-growth-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Bravo for Guy Molyneux's thoughtful and provocative article (\"When Productivity Is Up but Pay Isn't, Democratic Civility Is Down,\" Opinion, Feb. 15).

Soundscan, the company that tracks sales of recorded music (as opposed to shipments from manufacturers to stores), reported a similar increase. The difference between the two organization's statistics, is that where 1.1 billion pieces of music were distributed, according to the recording industry association, Soundscan reported 713.6 million were sold.

Far from stimulating crime and unbridled hedonism, the film suggests, the Netherlands' liberal attitudes on sex, drugs, abortion, guns (they are forbidden) and capital punishment (there is none) reflect a national temperament that is sedate bordering on glum. A word that keeps cropping up in the scores of interviews with Dutch Government officials and scholars about the country's approach to issues of individual freedom is \"pragmatic.\" The Government doesn't think in terms of good and evil.

Not Exactly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-pride-of-the-yankees-not-exactly.html","abstract":"  Who were these guys? Where had they come from? The answer, in Bill Henderson's case, was from a card buried in Rudy Santin's Rolodex.   Santin, the Yankees' Florida-based scout, pulled that card with Henderson's Miami phone number, and tried his luck at dial-a-catcher on Tuesday afternoon.   \"Been playing ball?\" Santin asked.   \"None at all, not for years,\" Henderson said. \"Sorry.\"   Nothing to be sorry about, Santin told him. And less than 48 hours later, Bill Henderson, whose last play was a home-plate collision six years ago, was pulling up his pin-striped pants one leg at a time, just like Joe D., Mickey and the Babe.   This little tale from the crypt once known as the Yankee clubhouse should give you an idea of what's going on here, at the start of replacement spring training, which is a joke, \"Star Search\" on Broadway. If the Yankees had this much trouble assembling pitchers and catchers, they may soon be picking position players out of the telephone book.   \"Some of these young men could earn positions in our organization,\" said George Steinbrenner, repeating the line the Yankees obviously fed their pitchers, catchers and dreamers. \"There might be some future star.\"   Now, there is only one, and he was not in uniform this morning. After more than two decades of trying, Steinbrenner is finally the biggest of all the New York Yankees. There is no one around who could possibly upstage the Boss.   That's why journalists grabbed hold of him the moment he hit the field, and Steinbrenner refused to let go. \"O.K, that's it,\" he would say after a while. Then he'd move a few feet, and start talking all over again.   His new sultans of swat would pass by, look up at him with reverence and gratitude. Fans pushed their paper and pens in his face and peppered him with questions and advice. George signed. George bantered. George leaned across the rail and planted a kiss on the cheek of a young girl. A guy who looked just like Don Mattingly -- honest -- told him the players would soon crawl back.   \"George, you've lost weight,\" an elderly gent told him.   That he had. A few more pounds, and he might have been out there, jogging alongside the nobodies in the most famous uniform in American sports. \"No, sir,\" Steinbrenner said to that proposition. He is the owner. The players are the players, even if they are not the players.   So who were these guys and where had they come from? Some were from the Yankees' minor leagues, in career atrophy, hoping to score organizational points. The others were the unremorseful has-beens we've been reading about these past few weeks, fantasy leaguers on leave from life.   \"I was between jobs,\" said Bill Henderson, holder of a marketing degree. \"My new job starts March 1. The boss said, 'Go for it.' \"   Henderson, 26, once went for the money, right out of high school, as the Detroit Tigers' 1987 first-round draft pick. Two years later, in the Florida State League, he was bowled over in a play at the plate, a season-ending injury that sent him back to school, for good.   At least he didn't sustain a concussion. \"He was out . . . I held on,\" Henderson recalled.   I'll admit that I'm breaking my personal oath to refrain from this \"I have a dream\" replacement material that strikes me, depending on the moment, as unpalatable or preposterous. Couldn't help it, especially after the way Henderson answered the question of how much he missed baseball after last summer's strike.   \"Actually,\" he said, \"I've always thought the baseball season was too long. By the time August comes around, I'm watching football.\"   How's that for expert commentary on the state of the national pastime? It might even have stopped Steinbrenner, as he blabbed on at the top dugout step, about how much baseball is \"interwoven into the American fabric,\" and how in small Indiana towns, men sit around all winter \"arguing who's better, Gehrig or Mattingly.\"   Meanwhile, journalists were so interested in the first workout of Steinbrenner's replacement Gehrigs that they surrounded the owner, pushing closer until one newspaper reporter, tired of being elbowed from behind, suddenly began landing punches to the head of a stunned magazine photographer.   The reporter was so quick with his right that Steinbrenner yelled out, \"Give that man a uniform!\"   For once, the reporter could compare himself to the athlete and know he had a better job.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950217","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/style/chronicle-544895.html","abstract":"  SHARON RICH, the author of three books about Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, will be making a pilgrimage to Washington next Friday on behalf of the two crooners, who appeared together in eight films.

When the American-born painter R. B. Kitaj's exhibition opened at the Tate last year, the reviews were so hostile that he announced he wouldn't show his work in England ever again. That was saying a lot for someone who had lived there more than half his life (he's 62), and who even coined the phrase \"School of London\" to describe the group of prominent painters that included himself, Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud. But Mr. Kitaj has always been a person to say what is on his mind, sometimes to his detriment.   Now that the retrospective is here you may well wonder what the fuss was about. If you go to the Met expecting another Freud exhibition, meaning one as galvanic and intense as the show of his work the museum had a year back, you'll be disappointed. This show has its inspired moments, though Mr. Kitaj is a painter whose ambitions outstrip his art. He deserves credit for those ambitions, and certainly not the caning he got in the British press. But his paintings can sometimes be abstruse and pretentious, and there are too many weak recent pictures on view to come out of the Metropolitan with more than mixed feelings. A Kitaj exhibition now at Marlborough Gallery in Manhattan includes some better new work that doesn't alter the bottom line.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950217","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/nyregion/no-headline-806995.html","abstract":"  \"We all just stopped and did a little praising God.\" DWAYNE CARR, after finding a baby who had survived a tornado in Alabama.

Sailing on one of Irving Berlin's most rhythmically propulsive scores, the production doesn't touch ground until the final reprise of that irresistibly buoyant Berlin ode to romantic giddiness, \"You're Just in Love.\"    The musical, with songs by Berlin and a book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, had the first of four concert performances on Thursday as part of City Center's Encore series of revivals.

Her postings on the computer bulletin board America Online were repeated word for word in magazines; her arrests, scandals and the drug overdose of the bassist in her band, Hole, made national headlines. Her travels to Buddhist monasteries and lingerie shops were followed in gossip columns, and speculation about her dalliances and the upbringing of her 2-year-old daughter became a voracious hobby among fans and detractors.    On Tuesday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, as Hole taped an \"Unplugged\" performance for broadcast on MTV in April, Ms. Love struck back. \"Look out the window and what do I see?\" she sang in her hoarse growl. \"Dozens of people staring back at me. And it's strange.\" The song, \"Season of the Witch,\" an altered version of the Donovan tune, took on new meaning in light of Ms. Love's ascendancy to most-watched celebrity status. Its chorus, \"You guys pick up every stitch/Must be the season of the witch,\" sounded like the anguished cry of a woman who can't sneeze without being accused by some of not having used a tissue and promised a tissue factory by others.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950218","headline":"Trial Opens In Girl's Death by Bowling Ball","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/nyregion/trial-opens-in-girl-s-death-by-bowling-ball.html","abstract":"  A battered bowling ball perched in a baby's car seat on a courtroom bench provided a stark backdrop to the opening of a manslaughter trial today.

For a decade or more, this quartet's performances have been abrasive and perfunctory, more like slugfests than like the reasoned discourse that is the chamber music ideal. So it was a pleasant surprise to hear warmth and passion in the group's playing on Monday evening at Alice Tully Hall.   The quartet began with a piece from slightly off the beaten path, Juan Crisostomo Arriaga's Quartet in E flat, one of three he published in 1824, less than two years before his death at the age of 20. In its time this was a conservative piece; its opening resembles Beethoven's First Quartet, composed a quarter-century earlier. Yet Arriaga's music also has an individualistic and slightly peculiar harmonic touch that makes it worth reviving.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950218","headline":"Life Transforms A Sculptor's Art","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/style/IHT-life-transforms-a-sculptors-art.html","abstract":"Jacques Zwobada (1900-1967), a French sculptor descended from Czech immigrants, began his career as highly competent but academic..At age 40, a passionate and durable liaison with the wife of his closest friend apparently sparked a mutation in his art,","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19950218","headline":"A Criminal Runs Out of Luck","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-a-criminal-runs-out-of-luck.html","abstract":"  Harvey Hahn, a 40-year-old career criminal, may have beaten a murder conviction this week, but his luck didn't hold.

Concussions are here today, but not necessarily gone tomorrow, which is why Aikman and six other pro quarterbacks convened here today for the most squeamish of seminars.    A panel of doctors was granted an audience this afternoon with Dallas's Aikman, San Francisco's Steve Young and Minnesota's Warren Moon -- to name three -- and, at day's end, there was a recommendation to make concussions a leaguewide headache. Leigh Steinberg, who brainstormed the convention and is the agent for all of the quarterbacks, will submit a proposal to the National Football League's competition committee, and, at the least, he hopes quarterbacks of the future will be treated like punters: gingerly.    Steinberg and his panel of neurologists -- doing much wishful thinking -- will also call for the elimination of artificial turf, a re-evaluation of helmet wear and the inclusion of a sideline medical referee, whose sole job would be to rule on a player's ability to play.    Aikman could easily be the concussion poster boy. He has suffered six in his six-season career, and he can barely recount his most recent Super Bowl. He still wears linebacker Wilber Marshall's fingerprints under his chin -- or helmet prints, to be exact -- and league officials confirmed today there could be rule changes coming that keep quarterbacks upright.    \"How can they possibly help?\" asked Young, the league's reigning most valuable player. \"They're going to make a lineman yell before he hits you?\"    According to the league executive Joe Browne, it is conceivable that the league -- at the behest of its subcommittee on concussions -- will expand a quarterback's safety net next season. Under current rules, pass rushers cannot overtly maim a signal caller in the pass pocket, but can club him outside of that realm. That's exactly why Marshall, the Arizona linebacker, was not penalized or fined after he blasted Aikman last season -- because Aikman had roamed from the so-called pocket -- but that rule might be amended at the league meetings in March.    \"It was pretty intense,\" Aikman said today, recalling Marshall's gruesome, helmet-first assault. \"I don't know if I've recovered yet from that thing.\"    Post-concussion syndrome was a large topic of discussion today, and doctors on the panel tried to clear up several myths. First, team trainers -- when determining the severity of the blow -- should not ask the player if he can remember the score or what he ate for breakfast. It is more helpful, they said, to examine his ability to concentrate by asking him to recite the months of the year backward. If a player conquers that question and then shows no amnesia in the next 20 minutes, he should be allowed to re-enter the game.    The doctors also warned that many quarterbacks can play deftly despite their concussions -- but may not remember one single touchdown pass. This, in fact, is what happened to Aikman in the playoffs of January 1994. He suffered a concussion in the conference championship against San Francisco and still did not have his complete equilibrium for the ensuing Super Bowl against Buffalo.    \"I said at the time had it been a regular season game, I probably wouldn't have played,\" Aikman said today. \"I was having headaches that week. But, for me, it's the Super Bowl. I know you're saying, 'You're an idiot, a moron for playing.' But, to me, it doesn't matter.    \"I remember playing the game, but not much more. My first Super Bowl, I remember everything that took place at the Rose Bowl, and, to this day, everything's clear. The second one in Atlanta, though, I don't have a clear recollection.\"    Doctors today then gave Aikman something else to chew on: concussions make a person more susceptible to Alzheimer's Disease later in life.    \"People this year were asking me, 'When is enough, enough,' \" Aikman said. \"The next one could maybe be my last one. I've said before if it comes to the point that I'm worrying about concussions, I will get out.\"    In the interim, most of the quarterbacks today were not scared away from the sport.     \"We can't make it flag football, can we,\" said Washington's John Friesz, who also joined the Rams' Tommy Maddox, Jacksonville's Andre Ware and Cincinnati's David Klingler at the seminar.     And the only linebacker present this afternoon concurred.    \"Will I let up on quarterbacks now?\" San Francisco's Gary Plummer said, repeating a question. \"No way.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950218","headline":"Driver Out of Big Race","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/sports/sports-people-bobsled-driver-out-of-big-race.html","abstract":"  A year after he was disqualified from the Winter Olympics for a rules violation, the United States bobsled driver BRIAN SHIMER dropped a 675-pound bobsled on his right foot in Lake Placid, N.Y., Wednesday, breaking his big toe and forcing him out of the biggest race of the season, the four-man world championships at Winterberg, Germany.

For example, he advocated the proposal, wisely rejected by Congress, to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling.

Although there are daredevils who play the complete set in concert (several have done so in recent New York seasons), most cellists play one suite on a program, surrounded by works in different styles. Indeed, Bach might have looked askance at anyone willing either to play or to hear all six works in a sitting or two.   But on recordings, resistance to the compendium approach is largely futile. The medium imposes the expectation that works of a feather will flock together, concert hall esthetics notwithstanding. Besides, the suites fit handily on two CD's and make powerful calling cards for cellists. And there's a machismo issue. Barring extenuating circumstances, a recording that offers only selections from the series is tacitly regarded as an installment toward a complete traversal or a sign that the musician who made it is an eccentric or a wimp.   This approach puts a strain on cellists' imaginations, which is not necessarily a bad thing. As remarkably varied as these suites are once one looks into them, they are similar in their externals. And however fondly one regards the sound of the cello, it can become monotonous in the two and a quarter hours it takes to play the suites. The challenge for a cellist, therefore, is to magnify the variety Bach wrote into the set.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"Tree Tips Over, and a Block Rises Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-tree-tips-over-and-a-block-rises-up.html","abstract":"  There are 19 trees on 100th Street between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive.

Proponents of a change say that in a county where 43 municipalities have autonomy over such matters proposals to centralize power are likely to result in controversy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"Wide Selection of Programs for Children in a Vacation Week","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/nyregion/music-wide-selection-of-programs-for-children-in-a-vacation-week.html","abstract":"  IT is vacation time for many children, and several organizations are offering programs for them.

You may at first be taken aback by the \"Mailbox and Garden for Christo,\" all wrapped in cloth and bound with rope, but you'll be happy to await your host in the \"Hallway for Georgia O'Keeffe\" among huge, pulpy white, yellow and pink flowers. Perhaps you'll be asked to sit and watch the Cubist \"Couch and TV for Pablo Picasso,\" but if you have to go directly to \"A Guest Room for El Lissitsky,\" don't panic. The decor may be too geometric for your taste -- rectangles, circles and planes of all kinds in white, red, orange, black and brown -- but the room is very functional. ARTHOUSE (Chronicle, $16.95) is the invention of Graham Percy, an illustrator who was born in New Zealand and now lives in London. It is an imaginary residence built on centuries of Western art, a place where eyes and mind come to play, a source of cheerful wonder. Is it a personal pantheon in which \"A Children's Room for Giorgio de Chirico\" (somber and architectural) and \"A Window Box for Henri Rousseau\" (where a lion sits under leafy plants) are homages to the masters Mr. Percy venerates? Did he instead, after years of respect, decide to take revenge, poke fun and devise a bathroom with a tiny toilet, a little dog and three white balls in a wooden box for Joseph Cornell, or a dollhouse built with Brillo boxes for Andy Warhol? After several visits to \"Arthouse,\" Mr. Percy's intentions cease to matter much. From his sunny arrangement of oranges in \"A Refrigerator for Paul Cezanne\" to the lonely potted plants facing a desolate lawn in \"A Back Porch With Cacti for Edward Hopper,\" the glow of Mr. Percy's love of art and life makes you want to come back.

In the largest exhibition of his work ever mounted -- more than 600 works -- the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin is now seeking to portray him as a multitalented figure who skipped effortlessly from expressionism to Dada to realism, not simply a master of painting and drawing but also a photographer, poet, collagist, designer, illustrator, pornographer, dandy and outraged opponent of Nazism.    Grosz was an artist who thrived on contradictions, and many of them are visible in \"George Grosz: Berlin-New York,\" which opened last month and runs through April 17.

Unrepentantly partisan, it has glorified the homegrown and avoided pretension in its mission to frame the humor, poetry and music of what is sometimes called the street, defined as anything American, anything separate from the academy. And the party, which runs Tuesday through Sunday, explains where the club has been: Allen Ginsberg, Shirley Horn, Bobby Short, Dick Gregory, Pete Seeger and Professor Irwin Corey are all showing up to pay tribute and to perform.   That list -- and the staggering lineup of performers over the years, from Barbra Streisand and Woody Allen to John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk -- also suggests that the Vanguard, small, underground and unprepossesing, has been a witness to and participant in a startling transformation: the elevation of its esthetic from the marginal and hip to the mainstream. The Vanguard has been a shrine for what is good about this century, and the century has caught up with it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"ART;\nThe Overblown 80's Prove Persistent Indeed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/nyregion/art-the-overblown-80s-prove-persistent-indeed.html","abstract":"THE 1980's in the visual arts, as well as in the rest of culture, are in an anomalous position.

This attitude is only beginning to be overtaken by a general feeling of retrenchment that marks the 90's.\n\nThe exhibition consists of drawings, many of them as large as wall murals, by the major artists of the decade -- those who came of age during the 80's, who made their reputations then and in some cases are having trouble holding on to those reputations now. They include Julian Schnabel, David Salle, Eric Fischl and Jeff Koons. Other artists are perennial. They were major players before the 80's and continue to be.

In part, it was the admission price, probably higher because of the loss of grants.    But I was also dismayed that barely five years since one of the most historic events of the second half of this century, there is only minimal recognition that the checkpoint, the symbol of freedom for some and oppression for others, ever stood on Unter den Linden. Only a small sign, not even an official one, reading \"Checkpoint Charlie,\" and a few capitalists offering Cold War relics and chunks of the wall attest that this Berlin intersection has any significance.

In part, it was the admission price, probably higher because of the loss of grants.    But I was also dismayed that barely five years since one of the most historic events of the second half of this century, there is only minimal recognition that the checkpoint, the symbol of freedom for some and oppression for others, ever stood on Unter den Linden. Only a small sign, not even an official one, reading \"Checkpoint Charlie,\" and a few capitalists offering Cold War relics and chunks of the wall attest that this Berlin intersection has any significance. I found it ironic that I nearly got lost on my way there, almost missing a landmark that was once so unmistakable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"Putting The Heat On 85th St.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-east-side-putting-the-heat-on-85th-st.html","abstract":"  \"They come from all over and from all walks of life -- from a banker or a broker to the unemployed,\" said the 19th Police Precinct commander, George J.

It is two blocks from the Hunts Point Market, the city's largest distributor of fruits and vegetables, and three blocks from an elementary school and a residential neighborhood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"Wealth Doesn't Make Moral Superiority; Flat Tax, Property Loss","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/opinion/l-wealth-doesn-t-make-moral-superiority-flat-tax-property-loss-093095.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Not only does the flat tax create benefits for those who earn more than $200,000, but it also creates extra benefits for those in low-cost states.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"On Secluded Barbuda","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/travel/on-secluded-barbuda.html","abstract":"BARBUDA is an island for those in search of nature and seclusion, with few distractions. The roads are dirt, not paved. Apart from the lone village of Codrington, population 1,200, and a few hotels, the 62 square miles are covered with scrub, cacti, hibiscus and bright red flamboyants. Wild donkeys, horses, deer and boar, along with free-ranging domestic goats and sheep, calmly graze. Forming a frame around this rather bland landscape are continuous pink and white sandy beaches. And beyond the beaches and their aquamarine waters, reefs with acres of fantastically shaped coral and gloriously hued tropical fish protect this peaceful retreat from cruise ships and other potential intruders.\n\nDuring a vacation with a friend last winter on this Leeward island 28 miles north of Antigua, I spent my first few days on the beach. My hotel, the Palmetto, was politely situated just back from the sand, so its architecture did not intrude. The only manmade structures on the beach were six white wooden cubes with chairs offering a rest in the shade. This beach, on a peninsula called Palmetto Point, had larger waves rolling onto its eastern shores and calmer waters facing west. The sand glittered pink. It was, on close inspection, not pink sand but tiny pink shells, sprinkled on the shore by the incoming tide. Aside from a few little lizards darting in the bushes behind us, and the island of Nevis far off on the horizon, there was no sign of life in any direction.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19950219","time":"1995-02-19
