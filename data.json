Ratings, of course, are at the heart of the matter. And no network has yet gone broke overestimating its audience's appetite for sleaze. Monday's broadcast of NBC's \"Amy Fisher: My Story\" was one of the highest-rated television movies this season, second only to the two parts of \"The Jacksons: An American Dream\" on ABC.

The deed she commits is hideous, the swiftness of the act frightening, but she does not have the aspect of a villain. In her insane urge to rescue her stepdaughter's reputation, to save Jenufa by murdering Jenufa's child, she somehow saves herself from unambiguous damnation. The forgiveness she receives is the linchpin of a matchless dramatic structure, one in which the most lurid deed is committed by a woman but the anterior crimes are committed by men.   Anja Silja, singing at the Metropolitan Opera for the first time in more than a decade, had mixed success as Kostelnicka in a cast change on Tuesday night. From her entrance in the middle of Act I, she seemed a bit off the mark. The character first enters almost unnoticed, marching across the stage and then off again with a single cold remark. Then, a few minutes later, she stops a scene of drunken merriment dead in its tracks with a fierce monologue of scorn. Ms. Silja caught the coldness very well, but her second entrance did not cast the proper shadow of overpowering authority. The role is something of a vocal nightmare, and Ms. Silja's lyric-dramatic soprano did not have enough fullness of tone in the upper register. The acting was finely shaded and intelligent, but a certain demonic spark was missing. These are intangible qualities, but \"Jenufa\" depends upon them to make its fullest impact.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921231","headline":"Today's TV Listings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/31/arts/today-s-tv-listings.html","abstract":"  Television listings appear today on page B15.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921231","headline":"Political Memo; The New Year at a New Age Retreat: The Clintons in Agreeable Company","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/31/us/political-memo-new-year-new-age-retreat-clintons-agreeable-company.html","abstract":"  The sight of the President-elect and the First Lady-elect arriving here today with monogrammed (BC and HRC) matching overstuffed boxes of work papers to celebrate New Year's Eve by talking about \"personal and national renewal\" with 1,500 friends invites the question:   Is America really ready for the Renaissance?","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19921231","headline":"Police Query 2 in Search For Girl, 10","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/31/nyregion/police-query-2-in-search-for-girl-10.html","abstract":"  As the authorities continued to search for Katie Beers, the 10-year-old who disappeared from a Long Island video arcade on Monday, a lawyer here said today that the police were focusing on two of his firm's clients as possible suspects in the case.

Yeltsin of Russia prepare to sign a treaty cutting deep into their nuclear arsenals, Ukraine has been tugging at their sleeves with an awkward and unwelcome question: How much will it cost to get rid of weapons of mass destruction, and who is going to foot the bill?   The United States has pledged $800 million to help the states of the former Soviet Union cope with the enormous task of dismantling a vast arsenal of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons. But diplomats here say the cost is likely to be considerably greater.   In Moscow this week, a Ukrainian diplomat told reporters that the cost to Ukraine alone will be more than $1.5 billion, a sum he called on the international community to pay. Some experts say that Ukraine's hesitations about renouncing its nuclear status are already casting a pall over the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start II, even before it is signed in Moscow this weekend. Lisbon Pacts Await Approval    Concerns about costs, but also about Ukrainian security, are the main reasons the Ukrainian Parliament has balked at ratification of arms-reduction agreements reached earlier this year in Lisbon. There, all four of the Soviet Union's successor states with nuclear weapons -- Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus -- agreed to abide by Start I, which made the first step toward cutting nuclear stockpiles.   But only Russia and the United States have actually ratified the treaty. The parliaments of the other three republics have so far held off not only formal approval of Start I, but also ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Until its neighbors agree to these accords, Russia has made it clear it will not begin the slow and costly process of eliminating its own nuclear arsenal.   Of the three, Ukraine has protested the loudest, calling the attention of both Russia and the West to what it considers the inequities of the financial burden of disarmament. At a news conference in Moscow this week, Ukraine's Ambassador to Russia, Vladimir Kryshanovsky, said the \"very complicated, very difficult economic situation in the Ukraine\" was one of the obstacles to the Parliament's ratification of Start I and the non-proliferation treaty.   Most observers see the Ukrainian inaction as a bargaining tactic, designed to wrest greater pledges from both the West and Russia for assistance in helping convert to a non-nuclear status. But there is also a parliamentary minority that wants to take another look at Ukraine's commitment to renounce nuclear weapons, as a way both of keeping the West's attention and of protecting itself against Russia.   The longer Ukraine withholds final approval of Start I and the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, the longer the shadow it will cast over the agreements to be signed in Moscow this weekend.   \"If the Ukrainians don't ratify, then it is a show-stopper for both agreements,\" said one Western diplomat, referring to Start I and Start II.   As it is, President Yeltsin is likely to face a tough debate in the Russian Parliament over the ratification of Start II, perceived by some here as favoring the United States.   With 176 intercontinental missiles and 16 long-range Backfire bombers based in Ukrainian territory, the republic's participation is crucial to the dismantling of the old Soviet nuclear system. Under the terms of Start I, most of these weapons would be transferred to Russia over the next seven years. The rest would be removed under the non-proliferation pact. Security, Environment, Trade    In Kiev this week, Dmytro Pavlychko, head of the Parliament's foreign affairs commission, said he was certain the Parliament would ratify Start I, but not before February. He said the Parliament had three main concerns -- a commitment by nuclear powers to defend Ukraine against aggression, guarantees against environmental damage and the ability to trade directly with buyers of the nuclear material taken from missiles.   As it watches Russia sell the plutonium used in nuclear weapons to the United States for cash, Ukraine is seeking compensation for the nuclear material inside the missiles on its territory, either by selling it to Russia, or to the United States directly, or trading it for fuel for nuclear power stations.   Given the unknowns surrounding the technology required to dismantle weapons of mass destruction, no hard estimate can be made on how much it will cost either Russia or the United States to neutralize the 18,000 nuclear warheads due to be eliminated under Start I and II. But the sum is expected to be considerable, and the burden is likely to be carried mainly by the United States, diplomats said.   \"The assumption of the Russians is that this is a continuous process, and clearly there is an American interest involved here in seeing them maintain it,\" said one Western diplomat. \"I think we will be stunned by the costs of taking apart the arsenals built up on both sides.\"   The first installment of the American aid, $165 million, has been earmarked for several specific disarmament projects, including $25 million for a center to monitor the dismantling, $25 million for the disposal of chemical weapons, $50 million for special containers to transport radioactive material and $20 million for special railway cars.   The Ukraine has been promised $175 million to help pay for removing and transferring weapons to Russia.   Teams of American specialists have already visited Russia several times as advisers on nuclear-dismantling techniques. But several important decisions remain, including whether to build just one center for storage and dismantling, and where the center or centers should be located.   With 20 intercontinental missile bases and about 850 multiple-warhead missiles, Russia has by far the largest arsenal of the former Soviet republics. But these bases are widely dispersed within Russia and, unlike American bases, they are not equipped with storage facilities for nuclear warheads. So the removal of the warheads requires that they be transported, often over long distances, and then stored in specially constructed warehouses as they await destruction.                      --------------------       Talks Set for Washington    WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (Reuters) -- Ukraine is sending a top official to Washington for talks with the Bush Administration and President-elect Clinton's team.

Jeff Buckley sings in a liquid tenor that recalls the sound of his father, Tim Buckley; whether he's singing old gospel or his own material, he pours on intensity. And Bianca Miller, who gives herself middle names like Flystrip, takes the point of view of a sweetly savvy downtowner who has laughed off a lot of heartache and flimflam.

Artists and photographers have depicted American Indians with attitudes ranging from fascination and admiration to incomprehension. In this they have reflected their audiences. At different times, Indians have been seen as the rightful owners of the American land, actual or potential enemies, or proud and noble tribal people; often they have been regarded as all three at once.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930101","headline":"Brazil's New President to Push Job Growth","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/01/world/brazil-s-new-president-to-push-job-growth.html","abstract":"  Two days after assuming office, Brazil's new President, Itamar Franco, unveiled his economic program today, a package that probably will slow the country's move toward open, deregulated markets and an economy based on a low inflation rate.

That it is possible to say this three years after the advent of the decade serves as a sad monument to President Bush's indifference to the nation's social and economic vitality. The statement also defines the task before Bill Clinton, a man of untested promise who has the opportunity and the obligation to shape the ethos of a decade.   New Year's Day is a good time for the President-elect to reflect on why we have been marking time. George Bush had a chance to shape the Nineties, just as two other Republicans, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, shaped their decades.

The trombone, an instrument typically associated with slides and energy and swing, with sudden moves and blasts, is here turned into an almost introspective isolate: lyrically mourning, then raging and mourning again. At the beginning, it sings a low, two-note sigh that is almost a groan. Slowly, as if through accumulated grief, that motif grows, supported by shimmers in the orchestra and given energy by roiling percussive thunder.   The work is distinctive, unsettling, yet structurally clear. It was a Philharmonic commission for the orchestra's 150th anniversary and was given a stunningly virtuosic performance by Joseph Alessi, the principal trombonist.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930101","headline":"Loans Trickle to Residents After Heavy Storm Damage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/01/nyregion/loans-trickle-to-residents-after-heavy-storm-damage.html","abstract":"  Almost three weeks after a ferocious rainstorm swept the region, Federal loans and grants have begun to trickle out to residents whose homes and property were damaged.

The front-runner for 1993 Art Pet of the Year may not be as flashy, but it's at least as charming: a 2,000-year-old granite crocodile from Egypt. One of the latest acquisitions by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it has been installed in a corner of the pool that surrounds the Temple of Dendur, as if floating on the water, waiting to chomp the wayward visitor. The sculpture was made around the same time as the temple, which was dedicated to two young warriors who traditionally are thought to have drowned in the Nile River and may have been devoured by the crocodiles that populated it. There's another connection between sculpture and architecture: in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, crocodiles were associated with Isis, to whom the temple is also dedicated.   The stone reptile has one pair of feet in the past and another in the future, stylistically speaking: the decorative patterns along its sides owe a debt to Pharoanic Egyptian art, while naturalistic touches like its bony spine, the furrows of flesh around its neck and its springy pose look forward to the realism of later Roman art. Sculptures of crocodiles were commonplace in ancient Egypt, but this one is exceptionally large and handsomely carved.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930101","headline":"VANCE HEARTENED ON EVE OF PARLEY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/01/world/vance-heartened-on-eve-of-parley.html","abstract":"  As he prepared for the first full-scale conference since August of the belligerent parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyrus R.

It reaffirms the fact that Bread and Puppet is entertaining as well as uplifting. This time the message comes in a bright holiday wrapping.

In New York, as across the country, advocates for battered women are urging a re-evaluation of the harsh sentences usually given women who kill or assault the people who have abused them. A1. NEW YORK CITY EMPIRE GRANTED RATE INCREASE   The Cuomo administration granted a large rate increase to Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the state's largest health insurer, presenting 1.4 million New Yorkers -- many of whom cannot get coverage from commercial insurers -- with increases in premiums that will average 25.5 percent. The increases are to take effect immediately, though hope of a state-financed bailout remains. A1.   FEUD EXPLODES AT CITY HALL   A long simmering but little noted feud between two of the Dinkins administration's top officials -- First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel and Barbara J. Sabol, who heads the city's vast social services bureaucracy -- has worsened. Their relationship has become so bitter that it has undermined New York City's ability to forge strategies on social issues, advocates for the poor, union leaders and some city officials say. A1.   FASTER ACTION ON POLICE COMPLAINTS   Raymond W. Kelly, the New York City Police Commissioner, announced that when civil lawsuits include charges of excessive force, false arrest, assault or other misconduct against the police, the Internal Affairs Bureau would immediately investigate. B3.   HOUSING PROJECT TERRORIZED BY CRIMES   A series of crimes against women in a Brooklyn housing project have left residents fearful even to take out the garbage. The police say that at least 11 women and girls in two buildings at the Sumner project in Bedford-Stuyvesant have been attacked by one to three men. Six women were raped and sodomized, including three who were also robbed. B3. REGION HARSH QUESTIONS AFTER ABDUCTION   Almost a year before 9-year-old Katie Beers disappeared from the care of a family friend at a Long Island video arcade, her mother was warned by an official of the local Big Brothers organization that the friend's behavior sounded suspicious. And amid other reports of the man's unfitness as a baby sitter, many of the divisions haunting the Beers family came to light. B5.   PRIVATE AID BUFFERS STORM DAMAGE   Almost three weeks after a ferocious rainstorm swept into New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, Federal loans and grants have begun to trickle out to residents whose homes and property were damaged.

This year, Mr. Slatkin pushed his renovation forward. The Viennese bonbons kept their grip on the second half.
