Huge boulders act like mounds of Styrofoam, being tilted and lowered on all-too-visible ropes.   But then, a moment later, the Met's production redeems itself, taking on another character. The giant castle gradually sinks until it seems to become part of an underwater world; rocks rise with the Rhinemaidens playfully grasping the magic Ring that has finally been tossed to them. As the music swirls, that rock too lowers, the lighting shifts slightly and in the rear Valhalla can be discerned, engulfed in flames. It is an intelligent and compact solution to Wagner's attempts to show all three regions of his universe in the score's final pages.  The performance of the Met's first \"Ring\" cycle this season, which ended on Saturday afternoon after three previous Saturday matinees, seemed to combine that final scene's mixture of clunky artifice and supple grandeur throughout its 17 hours. Much of the grandeur was heard in James Levine's conducting, which could, at its best moments, be both subtle and sweeping, aware of the score's ambiguous shifts in expression as well as its more blunt invocation of motifs. But there was much else to take pleasure in as well, and there will be two other opportunities to do so: this Otto Schenk production of the \"Ring\" will begin again tonight with \"Das Rheingold,\" with all four works to be seen within the week, as Wagner originally wished; they will repeat again next week.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930419","headline":"With an Accent, All-Star Repertory Theater","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/19/arts/with-an-accent-all-star-repertory-theater.html","abstract":"  Often neglected, or at least not fully appreciated, is the role of television as the equivalent of an all-star repertory theater.

His base was Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters -- and since the international union was the target of Federal prosecutors and regulators, his survival depended on being beyond reproach. News analysis. B3. ADULT VIDEO STORES DRAW PROTESTS   Hundreds of residents in several neighborhoods rallied against what they called the proliferation of adult video stores, topless bars and nude cabarets in residential areas. The protesters descended on adult entertainment spots in the Murray Hill, Chelsea and Sutton Place neighborhoods of Manhattan as well as Marine Park, Brooklyn, calling for city zoning regulations that would bar such businesses from residential communities. B3. DINKINS APPOINTEE LEAVES SCHOOL BOARD   Dr. Westina L. Matthews, one of Mayor Dinkins's two appointees on the Board of Education, has resigned, adding another hitch to an already bumpy ride this year for New York City's public schools. Her resignation comes at a tense time for Mr. Dinkins, for whom education issues will be critical in the mayoral campaign. B3.

He recalls a bygone age of eccentric, flamboyant pianism, the heyday of legends like Hofmann and Horowitz. But his technique sometimes lags behind his chosen ideal. In the Chopin Second Concerto on Saturday night, certain passages were poorly articulated and ill focused; the interpretation unfolded more as a succession of startling moments than as a coherent whole. The Larghetto, however, left no doubt of Mr. Halim's gift for evocation and emotive intensity.   The central problem was the disparity between the pianist's sumptuous delivery and the somewhat meager resources of the New York Chamber Symphony, under the direction of Gerard Schwarz. Mr. Halim, perched at the edge of the stage, was under unforgiving scrutiny from the hall's close acoustics, and the orchestra did not provide full support.

If Ms. Lumpkin feels as if she's in \"limbo\" because of uncertainty about which way medical care is heading, let her listen to any fledgling writer or visual artist talk about limbo in their field, which may stretch for a decade or more -- without any guarantee of critical or financial success.    A young artist's apprenticeship is generally unsupported and ignored; uncertainty in the arts is the name of the game.    Why should Ms. Lumpkin and her peers in science assume that, just because they are smart and determined, things will turn out the way they planned from the moment they knew they wanted to be doctors?

Excerpts appear with each article.   Q Has it been the immigration experience, from your perspective, that different groups don't mix?      EMMA KRAMER-WHEELER, 16, Brooklyn (Edward R. Murrow High School): It's the language barrier for the most part.     JUAN RIVERA, 18, Brooklyn (Bushwick High School): Yeah, it's, like, in Bushwick. You walk inside the lunchroom, you know, any period, and as soon as you walk in, the biggest group here is, you know, Dominicans, as I said. And you have Puerto Rican people over here. And you have Jamaicans over there.  And then you have the mixed group over here. . . . And it's just like that's it. You know where your group is at.     Q Is there resentment of immigrants? For instance, resentment of their jobs?     BERNARDO VASQUEZ, 17, Manhattan (A. Philip Randolph High School): That's the problem with immigration nativism over here. Why should that person come over here and take my job? I'm American, right? But, no. I get on the job first. Why should they come? I don't care if they're more qualified. I have citizenship.      WUBNESH HYLTON, 19, Brooklyn (Hunter College): I know a lot of people who really don't care about -- you know, that fear for immigrants coming and taking jobs is just not there, because there was never no jobs there in the first place. So, they're not really concerned about, \"Oh, he's going to take my job,\" because I didn't have one.     Q When I say that word \"assimilation,\" what do you think of?      WUBNESH Well, conformity. Giving up your own identity, melting into another culture to get ahead. I know some of my Asian friends, I think, like, Asians have a hard time in society, because they're always stereotyped. It's completely different from anything that we know here. And they're always stereotyped as the model minority. And, so, they feel the need to assimilate. And one of my Asian friends was telling me she only dates white men. And another one of my Asian friends, she only dates black men. So, it's, like: \"My culture no longer means anything.\"     Q Do you ever have a sense of loss being here?     BERNARDO As a Dominican, I relate so much to the second motherland, which is the Dominican Republic. But over here, I guess all immigrants . . . have to identify with something that is not America. Because America is no culture.  America is a mixture of -- it is like the melting pot. So, we have to identify with something that is    our culture.   ZAIRE GRAHAM, 17, Bronx (High School of Fashion Industries): Being that in my family I have so much of everything, I don't know what nationality I am. Because I have ancestors that was raped, you know, so I have a little white. I have a little Creole. I have a little Cherokee Indian. The majority of it is black, true. But I have my grandfather's this, my mother has half of that. So I don't know what nationality I am.

The confusion stems from the fact that in Freud's day the term \"infant\" was used to describe the entire period of childhood (as well as the earliest year or two of life, as it is most commonly used today). By \"infantile amnesia\" Freud meant the absence, in adulthood, of conscious recollections of vast portions of childhood    after    the age of 2 and up to at least 6.
