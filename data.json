Receiving a few pennies for each lottery ticket bought, its coffers swell.

The new Speaker of the House has already called for its privatization as part of the pulverization of the public trough, and the debate to come may occupy Jim Lehrer even after Robert MacNeil privatizes himself. Newt Gingrich's intention seems to me misconceived, but difficult though it may be for friends of public broadcasting to get these words out, the man has a case.   To begin, why is it necessary, say in the New York City area, for a half-dozen public stations to carry so many of the same programs? Public broadcasting remains a set of uncoordinated, chronically uncooperative fiefdoms. If Mr. Gingrich can bring order to a messy system by sorting out educational programming, community programming and national programming and by reducing duplication (without eliminating competition), who, besides the people who may have to find more productive jobs, will object? PBS would be doing itself a favor if it came up with a comprehensive and comprehensible reorganization plan.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941219","headline":"Carter Is in Sarajevo, But No Progress Is Reported","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/19/world/carter-is-in-sarajevo-but-no-progress-is-reported.html","abstract":"  Former President Jimmy Carter stepped into the war-torn vestiges of Sarajevo today, proclaiming that Bosnia was a \"fine country\" but saying nothing to suggest that he could resolve its deep divisions.

It was also warranted and timely: young players are one of the more important stories in jazz now, and they deserve a forum in concert halls.   But the six bands didn't perform up to their abilities. At its best, the concert featured the pianist Eric Reed and his band turning the gospel standard \"Wade in the Water\" into a post-Coltrane exploration, with percussive, vague chords underlining a relationship between Coltrane's music and the church. At its least, it presented the vocalist Tess Marsalis, the former wife of Branford Marsalis, who, on the basis of this performance, isn't yet at the level of her peers. In between, a host of young musicians put forth oddly uninspired, short sets that rarely caught the vibrancy of their performances in clubs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941220","headline":"Open Office Windows Save on Energy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/20/opinion/l-open-office-windows-save-on-energy-160628.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re your Dec. 14 new article on the new Federal courthouse in Manhattan's Foley Square:","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941220","headline":"Intensity and Intimacy From a Single Voice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/20/arts/pop-review-intensity-and-intimacy-from-a-single-voice.html","abstract":"  Three or four tunes into her first set at Tramps on Friday, the singer Chaka Khan let rip a high note that had all the impact of a bullet hitting a plate-glass window.

Ms. Khan is sexual when she sings, but not in an obvious way; instead of the raucousness of the bump and grind, or even the eroticism of secrecy a whisper can suggest, she manipulates by being a friend.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941220","headline":"U.N.

The study by Prince Akishinonomiya Fumihito, the second son of the Emperor of Japan, and colleagues appears in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It also says that mitochondrial DNA evidence indicates the domestication took place even earlier than the 8,000 years ago previously estimated, probably in the area of Thailand, where the species is still found in the wild.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941220","headline":"President Outlines Cutbacks To Pay for Tax Relief Plans","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/20/us/president-outlines-cutbacks-to-pay-for-tax-relief-plans.html","abstract":"  President Clinton today outlined plans to reshape, abolish or sell off scores of Federal programs as a first step toward financing his proposed tax breaks for the middle class and remaining competitive with the Republicans in the race to shrink the Government.

The new definition is expected to help both researchers and clinicians separate chronic fatigue syndrome from a host of other conditions that can cause prolonged fatigue and that would require more specific therapy.

Because Mr. Cohen's field of study now runs from medieval Europe to late 19th-century rural America, accomplishing this goal within the \"New World\" scope required some sleight of hand. One could, for example, include the Spanish composer Tomas Luis de Victoria's setting of \"Ave Regina caelorum\" on the grounds that it was also sung in colonial Mexico, but that would open the door to a large part of the Old World repertory and, one would think, invalidate the theme.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941221","headline":"Nets Find Cool Way To Score A Victory","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/21/sports/basketball-nets-find-cool-way-to-score-a-victory.html","abstract":"  In accordance with the new National Basketball Association rules, forearms and elbows are not flying frequently.

People with knowledge of last week's collective bargaining negotiations confirmed tonight that the team owners have offered the players a deal that doesn't include a payroll tax.   It is the tax, which the players call a salary cap in disguise, that has been the deal breaker thus far in keeping the players locked out and postponing the start of the season for 81 days, as of today. The league also has offered the Players Association a deal that includes a salary tax, but the player representatives from the 26 teams emphatically rejected that approach tonight when they met at a lakefront hotel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941221","headline":"Hinting He Will Stay, Cortines Defends Work as Schools Chief","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/21/nyregion/hinting-he-will-stay-cortines-defends-work-as-schools-chief.html","abstract":"  Giving the clear impression that he had decided to stay on as the head of the New York City school system, Chancellor Ramon C.
