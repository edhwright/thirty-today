The students study with Roberta Guaspari-Tzavaras, a violinist whose public-school music program was canceled in a round of budget cuts but who persuaded her school board to let her continue to teach as long as she found her salary elsewhere.

Shot from moving cars, these views of block after block of anonymous rectangular buildings evoke a joyless environment in which the imagination is systematically stifled and where people live in a state of chronic, low-grade depression.   The film depicts this society's grinding down of Daniel Brenner (Kurt Naumann), an idealistic architect in his late 30's. Daniel, like many others of his generation, is deeply frustrated by life under the Communists but somehow tolerates it. Hired to design a miniature city on the fringe of Berlin, he fools himself into thinking that he can counteract the prevailing gloom with a cheerier, more innovative approach. Working with a hand-picked team of friends who were classmates in architecture school, he comes up with a design that incorporates rooftop gardens and modern sculptures and that has architectural variety and generous breathing space.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19931027","headline":"Widerøe Flight 744 crashes near Overhalla, Norway, killing six people.","pages":[{"title":"Widerøe Flight 744","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wider%C3%B8e_Flight_744","description":"1993 aviation accident in Norway","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Wider%C3%B8e_Twin_Otter.jpg/320px-Wider%C3%B8e_Twin_Otter.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":213},"abstract":"Widerøe Flight 744, also known as the Namsos Accident, was a controlled flight into terrain of a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter during approach to Namsos Airport, Høknesøra in Norway.

Then the audience goes crazy: the process of empathy banishes loss completely, and love returns, made as real as a stolen kiss.   Mr. Vandross, who is one of pop music's finest virtuosos, may also be one of its greatest actors, and at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night, where he did the first of four sold-out shows ending Saturday, he was in full command of his powers.

A series of hypothetical examples outline the current and projected costs of insurance coverage for a number of families or individuals in varying circumstances. Here are excerpts from the report, with White House's description and cost estimates. TWO-PARENT FAMILY YEARLY COST TO FAMILY NOW: Mary Sampson manages a small law office in San Jose, California. She makes $35,000 a year. Her husband, a minister, makes $30,000 a year. Today, they get their coverage through Mary's employer, who pays half their premium. They pay $2,940 a year, 8 percent of her salary, for their health care premiums alone, not including co-payments and deductibles. CLINTON PLAN: Assuming they choose an average-priced plan, the premium for Mary Sampson and her husband will be around $872 a year, or $73 a month. They could choose a higher cost plan, which would cost them more, or a 1ower cost plan, which would cost them less. COUPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS NOW: Dennis and Barbara Rutherford, who live in Hannibal, Missouri have a combined income of $21,200. Dennis was laid off from his high paying job with a large manufacturing firm in late 1990. At that time, both Rutherfords lost their health care coverage. They have been turned down for other coverage because of preexisting conditions -- Dennis' high blood pressure and Barbara's history of breast cancer. Since then, they have been unable to afford the $9,000 a year ($750 a month) premium offered by the only plan that will accept   them.  CLINTON PLAN: If Dennis and Barbara enrolled in an average priced plan, they would pay 20 percent of the $3,865 annual premium for a couple -- $773 a year, or $64 a month.  SINGLE PARENT WITH SICK CHILD NOW: Sara Bender, a 28-year-old broadcast journalist, lives in Columbus, Ohio, and makes $34,000 a year. Because she works for a firm which gets a lower cost premium for its healthy workers, she has been paying only $300 a year, or $25 a month for her health care coverage. CLINTON PLAN: If Sara enrolled in an average cost plan she would pay 20% of the $1,932 annual premium for a single policy -- $386 a year, or $32 a month. SINGLE PARENT WITH SICK CHILD NOW: Susan Addington is a single parent living in Virginia. She is self-employed with an income of $40,000 a year. Because her son has a serious chronic illness, she paid $3,000 in out-of-pocket costs and $5,000 in insurance premiums in just one year. Because she is selfemployed, she was only able to deduct 25% of her $5,000 premium or $1,250 of these costs. CLINTON PLAN: For the family share of her premium, for an average-priced plan, Susan will pay 20% of the $3,893 annual premium for a single parent family-- $779 a year. She will also pay the employer share for a single parent -- $2,479, for a total of $3,258-a-year or $272 a month. And she will be able to deduct 100 percent of the premium. PROFESSIONAL COUPLE NOW: Michael and Elizabeth Sands work and live in Memphis, Tennessee, and together earn almost $90,000 a year. Elizabeth is a graphic artist, making $40,000. Although Elizabeth's firm offers her health insurance, the couple chooses to receive their coverage through the architectural firm where Michael works, because it provides a more generous, comprehensive benefits package. Today the Sands pay $720 a year, or $60 a month, for this coverage. The total premium costs $4,400 a year, and the architecture firm pays the rest. CLINTON PLAN: The Sands want to stay with their current plan. Under reform, this plan will cost less than it does today because it wiII no longer pay for the uncompensated care delivered to the uninsured, saving 10 percent of the current premium cost. The average cost of a couple premium in the Sands' alliance is $3,865 but the Sands pick a plan that will cost $4,000. They will pay the dffference between 80 percent of the average cost plan, which is $3092, and $4,000, or $908 a year, $75 a month. LOW INCOME FAMILY NOW: Lars and Brenda Gustafson recently had a new baby, and Brenda resigned from her job shortly before the baby was born. Lars works for a messenger service in Minneapolis, Minnesota and takes home about $250 a week, or $13,000 a year. His employer does not offer him health insurance. As a result, he and his family have been uninsured for two years. CLINTON PLAN: Provided Lars and Brenda choose an average price plan, they will pay 20 percent of $4,360 or $872 for a two-parent family policy. But because Lars is in a two-parent family with income less than $14,781 a year, he is eligible for a discount, reducing his premium to $384 a year. FARMERS NOW: James Huggins, a self-employed family farmer in Kansas, makes $25,000 a year and has struggled to pay for health care coverage for himself, his wife and his 10-year-old son. He is only able to deduct one fourth of the $4,000 he pays in premiums each year. CLINTON PLAN: If James enrolls in an average cost plan, he will pay 20 percent of the $4,360 annual family premium or $872 a year. Like a business, James will also pay the employer share of his premium, which would normally be $2,479. However, that amount would exceed 7.9 percent of James' income, the limit on what employers are required to pay. Instead James will pay 7.9 percent of $25,000 or $1,975 for his employer share. James will pay a total of $2,847 a year, or $237 a month. For the first time, James Huggins will be also be able to deduct from taxable income the full cost of his health care premiums. -- Excerpts from HEALTH SECURITY: THE PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931028","headline":"Chretien Says He Wants Changes in Trade Accord","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/world/chretien-says-he-wants-changes-in-trade-accord.html","abstract":"  Fresh from the stunning triumph of his Liberal party in Canada's general elections, Prime Minister-designate Jean Chretien said today that he wants changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement and may not implement the pact without them.

Among the offerings, which go on view this weekend at the auction houses, are everything from the experimental to revivals, as paintings, sculptures and drawings with estimates totaling more than $207 million appear for the art market's autumn pulse-taking.   The usual pre-auction anxiety is evident as collectors, dealers and experts from all over the world flock to Sotheby's and Christie's to see works by artists ranging from Picasso and Renoir to Gorky and Hockney. Just how the market will fare in these economic times is the question everyone is asking. While this fall's auction catalogues are much leaner than those of the boom years in the 1980's, and the atmosphere is noticeably sadder, the experts who put the sales together are also far wiser.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931029","headline":"Pro Football; Taylor Confronts an Old Truth: At 34, Healing Can't Be Rushed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/29/sports/pro-football-taylor-confronts-an-old-truth-at-34-healing-can-t-be-rushed.html","abstract":"  Five years ago, even two years ago, Lawrence Taylor wouldn't have thought twice about playing in pain.

It seems appropriate, therefore, that the play's most voluble exponent for Jews converting to Christianity, the servant Launcelot Gobbo, should be portrayed (by David Manis) as a lout in circus-clown makeup.

Working entirely with the bright and mostly worthless trinkets to be found in souvenir stores, gift shops, toy stores and party-decoration outlets, Mr. Mantello has turned the gallery into maze of zany installations and overloaded assemblage sculptures. He has also painted some walls hot pink, covered others with wallpaper or with blown-up resort photographs, and levitated helium balloons all over the place. Disco music emanates from one work, air freshener from another.
