This comparison, of course, is a tribute to Mr. Seymour's skill. He has taken on a formidable job in his novel, detailing the never-ending fight between the Irish Republican Army and the British forces opposing it. The plot is fairly complicated, there are many characters, and the author uses a kind of    cinema verite    technique, with constantly shifting frames. But the book never falters.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"His Wife Is Dead; He Is Ambivalent","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/books/his-wife-is-dead-he-is-ambivalent.html","abstract":"AMONG THE DEAD\n\nBy Michael Tolkin.\n273 pp. New York: \nWilliam Morrow & Company. $20.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"Article 220993 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/article-220993-no-title.html","abstract":"  Two months after a huge car bomb savaged the underpinnings of the World Trade Center, the authorities say signs are mounting that the most notorious terrorist attack on American soil was part of a wide conspiracy that involved the payments of large sums of money from abroad.

Excerpts appear with each article. Q    How do some of you define success in this society?       WUBNESH HYLTON , 19, Brooklyn (Hunter College): For myself I feel I'm successful. And I don't think it's as a result of the education system. I'm 19, I just moved into my own apartment, you know.  I'm in school, and I'm happy. I have a job, I'm doing something that I care about. ...     ZAIRE GRAHAM, 17, Bronx (High School of Fashion Industries): I have yet to accomplish success. For me, I'm successful to the point I made it -- to me. My senior year in high school; I can feel that I'm successful that I made it there. And I'm still there for the second term. But I have yet to become successful in my heart . . . because I want my college education. I want this not because society says I need it, but because I want it.      DOUGLAS KILCOMMONS, 17, Staten Island (Tottenville High School): I just want to interject something. I am like so, I am so impressed with like Juan and Bernardo and Zaire and Wubnesh. I am so impressed with you guys. ... In my school the biggest problem with minorities is they always feel like they are like under the gun.      Q    What do you mean by that?     DOUGLAS Under the gun? O.K., well they always feel like they're the ones who are like treated differently. And in some respects that is true, and I agree with that. However, you guys are the success, the minority success story in my mind. Look, all of you expressed today some of the problems that you had earlier, but you helped yourselves. And that's why it impresses me so much. ... And that is what we have to teach everyone to do.  Even white people who are down and out and like, you know, like bums laying on the street.      ZAIRE I don't know if I agree with the student that said that black youths don't focus on education. We must be focusing on education somehow 'cause we've got our black universities filled up with college students.     SUZANNE SCHAMING, 17, Staten Island (Tottenville High School): We have an honors program. And there is one black person I know that is in the honors program.  And I have talked to this girl on many occasions, and, once we had a Harmony Day last year, and she talked to our class.  . . . She constantly gets abuse from black people 'cause she's black and she's in the honors program.

ON STAGE, OFF STAGE: Memories of a Lifetime in the Yiddish Theater (Harvard University, paper, $29.95), written with Irving Genn, a family friend, combines selections from Buloff's reminiscences and correspondence with the memories of his wife and leading lady of 60 years, Luba Kadison. Much of their fascinating story concerns the Vilna Troupe, the celebrated Yiddish theater company where the two began their careers. Humor, pathos and occasional hyperbole characterize the authors' descriptions of the improvisation and absurdism that were part of everyday life for Jews in the Eastern Europe of the early 20th century. When Yiddish was prohibited on the stage, actors were instructed to ad-lib in a variety of tongues, even in gibberish, if the local secret police arrived. Buloff claims to have introduced the theater of the absurd with his expressionistic production in 1925 of \"Singer of His Sorrows,\" which Eugene Ionesco told Buloff influenced his own anti-naturalistic writing style. The couple made their way to New York in 1927. They appeared with Maurice Schwartz's famous Yiddish Art Theater. They also formed an amateur theater group in Chicago and toured South America. In the 1930's, Buloff made a successful transition into American theater and film, appearing in such Broadway hits as \"Oklahoma!\" and \"My Sister Eileen.\" \"On Stage, Off Stage\" conveys, simply and directly, an engrossing tale.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"That British Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/books/l-that-british-style-039093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In his review of \"Pandaemonium\" (April 4), Stanley Hoffmann argues that I \"confuse nationalism and ethnicity.\" Fair enough.

It was recreated in Dusseldorf in 1987 and in Los Angeles two years ago. The Los Angeles show traveled to Chicago, Washington and Berlin, everywhere provoking discussion.   But the Nazis' attack on the visual arts was just part of their broader assault on modernist culture. In 1938, a lesser-known exhibition in Dusseldorf, \"Degenerate Music,\" gave similar treatment to proscribed composers. That exhibition, too, was recreated 50 years later in Dusseldorf.

But throughout the five-year planning process, she said, as the library was streamlined and redesigned within its existing space of 13,100 square feet, she worked with the architect, Peter Gisolfi & Associates of Hastings-on-Hudson, to balance the latest in machinery with benefits of a more long-standing kind.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"ART;\nImages of Angst and Desire From a World in Upheaval","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/art-images-of-angst-and-desire-from-a-world-in-upheaval.html","abstract":"THE print portfolio, a series of prints that tell a story, has a long tradition in Germany.

But so far, Donnie Sellers says, that has not happened to him. If it did, though, it would be understandable.   That's because Mr. Sellers is living a dual life, working full time as a police officer in Norwalk, as he has for the last 26 years, and serving in the General Assembly in Hartford. In addition, he is serving his second term on the Norwalk Common Council, is in his sixth year as a member of the city's Fair Rent Commission and is in the Army Reserve.   That all leaves Mr. Sellers, 48, with little time for sleep. \"Fortunately I'm able to get by with very little sleep,\" he said in an interview at Norwalk police headquarters. \"I'm also fortunate in that I have a tremendous amount of energy.\"   Mr. Sellers is one of two police officers in the General Assembly. The other, Edwin Garcia, a sergeant in the Hartford Police Deparment, is also a freshman State Representative and, like Mr. Sellers, has to work an all-night shift in order to serve in the legislature.   But, as Mr. Garcia pointed out, \"When I'm at the State Capitol, I'm only five minutes from home and five minutes from work.\" By contrast, Mr. Sellers lives 65 miles from the Capitol and the trip, made almost daily, takes him about an hour and 15 minutes.   Only one other police officer has served in the General Assembly, Joseph Raia of New Britain. A Democrat, as are Mr. Sellers and Mr. Garcia, Mr. Raia served three terms before he was defeated in a primary in his city last May.   Indeed, Mr. Raia let his State Senator know that he supported a bill to permit police officers and other municipal officials to run for office. \"I had wanted to run for the legislature for some time, since I felt that police officers in the state were being treated by the legislature as second-class citizens,\" Mr. Raia said. \"But I couldn't because municipal workers were prohibited from running in Connecticut. So I told State Senator Joe Harper of New Britain that I was all for the bill.\"   The bill passed in October 1984. And two years later, Mr. Raia, who has been a police officer for 23 years, was elected to the General Assembly.  But unlike Mr. Sellers and Mr. Garcia, Mr. Raia took off days without pay when he had to be at the State Capitol. \"It cost me about $10,000 a year, plus about $6,000 in overtime,\" he said. That adds up to $16,000, which is what state legislators are paid, so Mr. Raia, in effect, broke even.   Before running for a vacant seat in the General Assembly in a special election last January, Mr. Sellers sought the advice of Mr. Raia and Mr. Garcia as to the feasibility of being a combination police officer and State Representative. \"They both encouraged me,\" he said with a smile. \"But then they don't live 65 miles from Hartford.\"  A Typical Day    On a typical day, Mr. Sellers, who is divorced and the father of three sons, works from 11 P.M. to 7 A.M. in the complaint bureau of the Norwalk Police Department, then goes home to get a few hours sleep before driving to Hartford. There, he spends up to eight hours attending legislative sessions, public hearings or meetings of the House Education and Labor and Employees Committees of which he is a member. Then Mr. Sellers drives home, catches a few more hours of sleep and is back at his desk in uniform at 11 P.M. \"Fortunately, I often have my days off during the week, which makes it easier for me in Hartford,\" said Mr. Sellers, who won his seat in the special election by a 2-to-1 margin while running with the endorsements of the Democratic Party and A Connecticut Party. \"When I do and I'm tied up late, I often stay over in Hartford with friends.\"   But on other days, neither snow, nor rain nor lack of sleep keeps Mr. Sellers from making his rounds as a state legislator and police officer. For instance, during the March 12 blizzard, Mr. Sellers, rather than drive, took a bus from Norwalk to Hartford because of the storm forecast. Then at the end of his legislative day, he hitched a ride with another Fairfield County legislator in order to get back home in time for the start of his 11 P.M. shift. \"It was kind of a rough day,\" he recalled. \"But everything worked out all right.\" Not to Mention Other Commitments    Still, at times Mr. Sellers has found himself wondering just what in the world he is doing, serving two masters, the legislature and the police department, not to mention his other municipal commitments and the Army Reserves (with whom he spent a recent weekend at Camp Smith, N.Y., near Peekskill).   \"There've been some doubts from time to time, but I'm sure it's going to work out just fine,\" said Mr. Sellers, who has walked a beat, ridden in a radio car and served as a community relations officer since joining the Norwalk Police Department in 1966. \"But I don't think I'm going to seek a third term in the Council this fall and I'll probably resign from the Fair Rent Commission.\"   No one will hold that against Mr. Sellers, whose councilmanic district includes a black and Hispanic section of South Norwalk where he still lives. That is primarily because of Mr. Sellers's popularity and visibility. Over the years, he has made it a point to come to know just about everyone in his neighborhood and, it seems, thousands of other people in Norwalk. Now he is determined to become acquainted with more people in the 140th legislative district, which includes most of South Norwalk but extends as far north as the Merritt Parkway. Directing Traffic With Flair    Given his style, that should not be too difficult. Few, if any, public figures in Norwalk are as recognizable as Mr. Sellers who has a penchant for flamboyant behavior, whether directing traffic or strolling the streets.   The question arises as to how Mr. Sellers got to know so many people in Norwalk. \"It's because I've been a people's kind of cop, and I've always made it a point to reach out,\" he said. \"And I go out of my way to get to know people. I even have my phone number listed, and I always have. Not many cops do.\"   Mr. Sellers's entry into politics came about indirectly. \"I was talking with Nick DePalma, who was then running for mayor as an independent and campaigning in South Norwalk in 1983,\" Mr. Sellers recalled. \"After a while, he said to me, 'Have you ever considered getting into politics?' I told him no, and he said, 'Do you realize people have been honking their horns at you nonstop since we started to talk?' It hadn't even dawned on me.\"   Later that year, Mr. Sellers received the Independent Party's nomination for the Common Council in his district. But no one had bothered to check the Police Department's manual, which then prohibited officers from seeking public office.   \"So I went to Mayor Frank Esposito and asked him if he would please appoint me to some board because I wanted to serve the people,\" Mr. Sellers said. Subsequently, Mr. Esposito appointed Mr. Sellers to the Fair Rent Commission. \"I called the local newspaper about it and had them take my picture and put it in the paper,\" Mr. Sellers said unabashedly. \"I wanted people to know that I was on the commission.\" Critics Take Attendance    In 1989, after the legislature changed the law, Mr. Sellers became the first police officer ever elected to the Norwalk Common Council when, running on the Democratic ticket, he won in a three-way race. \"When I was approached to run, I asked myself, 'Donnie, do you have a future in politics?' And I realized I was a very powerful black candidate. So I thought, go for the gusto. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, and opportunity knocks only once.\"   Mr. Sellers was re-elected to the Common Council in 1991. But since taking his Council seat, he has been criticized, mainly by Republicans, for missing too many committee meetings. Mr. Sellers does not deny that, saying it has been because of other priorities, including his three sons. \"Missing committee meetings hasn't affected my work as a councilman, and I never miss the actual Council meetings,\" he said.   Holding down two jobs is hardly new for Mr. Sellers, who is a graduate of the University of New Haven with a degree in political science. For six years he spent five hours a day teaching troubled middle and high school students in a special program at the Benjamin Franklin School in Norwalk. And during three of those years he also directed traffic outside of Pitney Bowes on Main Avenue in Norwalk from 3 to 6 P.M. five days a week. In addition, Mr. Sellers had started a boxing club for teen-agers and established a youth organization for young people from middle-class neighborhoods.   \"Norwalk's been good to me, and I want to give something back,\" Mr. Sellers said. \"And I think I understand people because I'm a grass-roots type of person. For instance, people in my Council district aren't issue-oriented. But they're petrified because of all of the crime. When they vote, they vote for me, Donnie Sellers, not the issues.\" 'My Own Mother Was Mugged'    Occasionally Mr. Sellers patrols his neighborhood in his car or on foot on his own time, in and out of uniform. It is a low-income area, riddled by drug-trafficking and crime, much of it violent. \"My own mother was mugged in my driveway at 5:30 in the morning as she was walking toward her car to go to work,\" Mr. Sellers said. But he remains upbeat, waving and calling out to residents. \"It's bad, but I do my best to try to make things better.\"   Even one of Mr. Sellers's sons has been scarred by illicit drugs. His son Earl, who is 21, has been arrested several times on drug charges and was shot and wounded in an apparent drug dispute in Stamford last September. He has spent time in prison and at several drug rehabilitation units.   \"I even locked Earl up myself,\" Mr. Sellers said. \"Once, he even stole my gun and sold it to get money for drugs. My reaction to all of that? To get him help. It's a disease. I love Earl, and we have a good relationship.\"   Mr. Sellers recalled how stories about him and Earl appeared in the same edition of the local newspaper in February. \"My victory in the special election was on page one,\" he recalled. \"And on page 3 there was a story about Earl being arrested. It shows that these things can happen to anybody.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"THE GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/the-guide-310693.html","abstract":"  NEUBERGER EXHIBITION   In celebration of the financier-art patron's 90th birthday, 50 of the 500 works of art contributed by Roy R.

His hair was newly cropped in the trademark close fade that inspires his friends to call him Baldheaded Shawn, or Barkley, after Charles Barkley, the basketball star. Around his neck he wore a small gold lion, a gift from his older brother, a sergeant in the Army. His backpack held his track shoes and his books.    Not long ago, Shawn Hunt, who at age 11 was a messenger for the neighborhood drug dealers and three years later was packing a .25-caliber pistol, seemed headed only for jail. But this year, at 17, almost everything has changed: He is an honor student at Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn, co-captain of the track team, a youth leader at his church. He holds down a part-time clerical job at Downstate Medical Center. Next fall he plans to attend Clark-Atlanta University in Georgia. He would like to be a psychologist or a sports-medicine doctor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"Article 220994 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/article-220994-no-title.html","abstract":"  Two months after a huge car bomb savaged the underpinnings of the World Trade Center, the authorities say signs are mounting that the most notorious terrorist attack on American soil was part of a wide conspiracy that involved the payments of large sums of money from abroad.

This time he's a lanky Wall Street broker who calls himself Lance, a regular guy with \"a rather extensive background in the area of diplomacy.\"\n\nRachel Swann, the feisty protagonist of \"Temptation,\" Cynthia Blair's latest novel, is not impressed at first.\n\n\"You don't look like a regular guy,\" she says. \"You look like a regular nerd.\"\n\nBut the wine, the rich food and Lance eventually get to Rachel, and she finds it in her soul to take stock of some insider information.\n\nThe rest of the plot, well, it just goes to the devil.\n'Purposely Sarcastic' Book\n\n \"Temptation,\" released this month by Ballantine and chosen for the Doubleday and Literary Guild book clubs, is Ms. Blair's first hard-cover novel, and she will sign copies on Wednesday at 8 P.M. at the opening of a Barnes & Noble bookstore in the Roosevelt Field shopping center.\n\nThe novel, with blurbs from Susan Isaacs and Anne Rivers Siddons, was hailed by Publisher's Weekly as energetic and broadly comic and ingenuously appealing. The jacket describes the book as \"a cautionary fable\" about a woman of the 90's, a single mother who juggles family and career while pursuing a romantic life. \n\nA writer of more than 30 paperbacks, about half for young adults, Ms. Blair, who lives in Sea Cliff, has a witty and irreverent style. \"My editor told me that I'm now considered to be a writer of what is called smart women's fiction,\" she said. \"It's purposely sarcastic. It holds nothing sacred and it has a bite to it.\"\n\nWhen Ms. Blair completed the manuscript two years ago, the character of Rachel was a single woman on her own. But the novelist decided to change her into a divorced, single mother. \"I felt there had to be more at stake, or else she would just seem capricious,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to Lance, the devil appears in the guises of a heavily rouged Avon lady and a callous building superintendent who flicks ashes on the carpet. In one scene the garish cosmetics saleswoman produces a small bottle of the perfume of the month, a Night in Heaven, and liberally sprays it about the room. After becoming overpowered by the horrible smell and feeling \"as if the perfume had invaded every molecule of her body,\" Rachel begins to take the Avon lady, or Auntie Agnes, into her confidence, saying:\n\n\"All my life I've been striving for things. To do things, to accomplish things, to get the things I want. And it's fun to do that, in a way. But at the same time, there's always this frustration. Frustration that comes from the fact that the whole time you're out there, doing your best, knocking yourself out, you're never really certain whether or not you're actually going to get the payoff you so badly want.\"\nUnexpected Turns in Life\n\n Many of her themes, Ms. Blair said, have to do with how people change when life takes unexpected turns.  Though Ms. Blair did not say that she had recently made any pacts with the devil, she bears other similarities to her main character. Like Rachel Swann, Ms. Blair is a writer and a single mother.\n\nAfter earning a B.A. from Bryn Mawr College and an M.B.A. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she began writing part-time while working as a marketing executive. Then she decided to concentrate fully on fiction. \n\n\"When I was in college I purposely suppressed the urge to write because it was such an impractical thing to do,\" recalled Ms. Blair, who grew up in North Babylon.\n\nOne snowy afternoon in Cambridge, Mass., while she was supposed to be writing her business school master's thesis, Ms. Blair was struck with the idea for a novel. In one sitting she wrote 50 pages of what turned out to be her first published book of fiction.\n\nMs. Blair's longtime editor at Ballantine, Pam Strickler, said: \"It was actually 'Close to Home,' the book prior to 'Temptation,' in which she really showed me the kind of writer she'd become. 'Temptation' confirmed it.\"\n\nNarrated in the same dryly observant voice as \"Temptation\" and set in Sea Cliff, \"Close to Home\" chronicles the life of a marketing executive who abandons her career for the rigors of being a full-time mother. The heroine finds juggling Animal Crackers and Legos even more demanding than the stressful pace of corporate life.\n\n\"I like setting reality against absurd situations because that's how life seems to play,\" explained Ms. Blair, who has signed a contract with Ballantine for two more hard-cover novels.\n\nMs. Blair cited a scene in \"Temptation\" when Rachel's boyfriend, Howard, makes a spectacle of himself at a flea market when he jokingly plants a rotating light with a suction cup atop his bald head and cannot remove it.  \"That really happened to my neighbor,\" Ms. Blair said. \"I asked him if I could use it in one of my books.\"\n\nNeither does Ms. Blair hesitate to poke fun at what she called \"the sensitive new-age man, a man who is content to sit on the sidelines and let the woman be the star.\"\n\nOne of Rachel's two sisters is encumbered by such a fellow, who in one scene is thrown into an emotional crisis when there is no unsalted butter in the house. For the sake of the sauce, he immediately rushes out to the store to replenish the supply.\n\nYet amid the humor and satire, Ms. Blair said, one lesson might be encapsulated in the axiom, \"Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.\"\n\n\"What's ironic,\" Ms. Blair added, \"is that one of the things the main character asks for is a boost in her writing career, and this is what this book is doing for me.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"CONNECTICUT GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/connecticut-guide-051493.html","abstract":"  FOCUS ON THE SOUND   The quality of Long Island Sound will be the focus this week of the Junior League of Eastern Fairfield County.

In February, The Wall Street Journal reported that agents were \"grabbing\" commissions as high as 25 percent while the airlines wasted away. Trade publications for the travel industry responded with editorials and articles pointing to the essential role of travel agents, who now sell 80 to 85 percent of the airline tickets in the United States, a statistic no one disputes. Agents were evidently pained because they believed the article made it appear they were taking juicy commissions, not quite the case in a time of dwindling profits.

As is well known, her persistence opened the floodgates for black American vocal talent, including artists like Leontyne Price, Jessye Norman, George Shirley, Vinson Cole, Kathleen Battle, Betty Allen and Shirley Verrett.   But Anderson's career may be worth considering in the context of the contemporary scene. For as the old racial restrictions have dissolved, the issue of race has actually grown in American consciousness. And for all the success of blacks in the opera house, in other forms of art music black presence is minimal and a cause of anxiety among concert presenters, foundations and political activists. That absence was the subject of a conference last weekend in Winston-Salem, N.C., at which Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto was played by the black nationalist Louis Farrakhan. The more mundane facts: fewer than 2 percent of professional orchestra musicians are black. Classical black instrumentalists can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Black composers of note are still more rare. Only in popular music have black musicians become prominent, even dominant.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"Where Asian Cuisine Can Be Sampled","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/dining-out-where-asian-cuisine-can-be-sampled.html","abstract":"  IN a travel-mad age, Asian Experience in Westport offers diners a quick culinary tour of Asia, a chance to sample dishes that might be found in 10 countries.

A strong wind affected the match with clay blowing across the court. In the final today, Pioline will play Sergi Bruguera of Spain who outlasted the defending champion, Thomas Muster of Austria, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (9-7), in the other semifinal. (AP) GOLF Sullivan Shares Lead Former Greater Greensboro Open champion Steve Elkington sank an 85-foot putt on the 17th hole yesterday to forge a tie with Mike Sullivan heading into the final round of the $1.5 million tournament in Greensboro, N.C. Elkington, who won the tournament in 1990, and Sullivan, who led after each of the first two rounds, were tied at eight-under-par 208 on the Forest Oaks Country Club course. Despite the strong winds on the course, Tom Sieckmann pulled off a rare feat, holing out a 267-yard shot for a double eagle. Sieckmann hit a 3-wood into the par-5, 574-yard ninth hole for his two. The hole is the longest on the 6,950-yard Forest Oaks Country Club course. Sieckmann finished at one-under 71. (AP) RUNNING Springtime and Couples On a day that was a perfect 10 and ideal for a couples tour of Central Park, the 15th annual Trevira 10-mile Twosome turned into a dual binational duel yesterday, but only among the men. Inna Poushkariva of Russia ran away with the women's race, while Simon Chemoiywo of Kenya and his countryman William Mutol fought off a series of challenges from a pair of determined Brazilians and finished one-two. Chemoiywo, who finished in 46 minutes 27 seconds, and Mutol (46:32) took turns in the lead as Delmir Dos Santos of Brazil (46:43) and his unrelated teammate, Valdenor Dos Santos (46:59), took turns challenging. Poushkariva, who took the lead for good at the 4-mile mark, finished in 55:18, ahead of Marion Sutton of England (55:53) and Madina Biktagirova of Byelorussia (56:05). Mutol and Sutton won the couple's competition in a combined 1:42:25, the third time a top Trevira finisher has not been on the winning team and the first time a pair of second-place finishers has won. HOCKEY U.S. Defeats Norway The United States defeated Norway, 3-1, yesterday in Dortmund, Germany, to gain a quarterfinal berth in the world championships. The Rangers' Tony Amonte and Darren Turcotte ignited Team USA by scoring two goals within 40 seconds in the second period after the Norwegians, who have yet to win a game, had taken a 1-0 lead. The victory left the Americans in second place in the Pool B standing behind the Czech Republic, which routed France, 6-2.

Penn was third, 1.9 seconds behind Navy. The defeat on the Schuylkill was the first loss for the Midshipmen varsity eight this season and the Harvard victory came two weeks after the Crimson lost by 10 seconds to Brown. The winning time was fast, 5 minutes 23.7 seconds. Navy broke out in front of the trio at the start of the 2,000-meter race. In Hanover, N.H., Brown continued its unbeaten ways by turning aside Dartmouth, last year's Eastern Sprints champion. The Bears won by 7.5 seconds in the current-aided time of 5 minutes 12 seconds.

Webb was charmed by the ditty. And on May 2, 1938, just a week after Fitzgerald's 20th birthday, he recorded it with her singing the vocal. Seven weeks after that session, \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\" was the No. 1 hit in the country. And the record, which was to be the only million-selling single of Fitzgerald's career (if you exclude a duet with the Ink Spots), became the biggest hit of 1938.

Prune magnolias before they flower in the spring, or wait until June, after they have flowered. If you want to eliminate any stems of the star magnolia, which is a multistemmed tree, it's best to do it the first year or so, before the stems get too thick.

It was drawn from the collection of Sheehan that was given to Wesleyan University by Mr. Trager and his wife, Ina.    Sheehan died in 1969 at the age of 47, having lived a life that was, to say the least, unlucky. His father was a psychiatrist more concerned with his patients than his family; his mother was an alcoholic and so, eventually, was he. He grew up in Scarsdale, attending high school there, and spent two years at Fordham University. With the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary and, while serving, sustained a burn that resulted in the loss of one eye. But this did not discourage him from resuming the photography he had started during adolescence and, by 1948, he was working in the still relatively new medium of Kodachrome.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"Fast Forward","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/style/fast-forward.html","abstract":"DAISY FUENTES hated the film \"The Mambo Kings.\"\n\n \"Let's not even talk about 'Mambo Kings,' \" she says.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"New Treads","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/sports/sports-people-bowling-new-treads.html","abstract":"  The Professional Bowlers Association is making a tire change.

The eveninglong flashback to follow unfolds largely in the dank brick welfare housing of depressed northern England. The offstage band is small and tinny enough to hold forth in a garage. There is not much dancing, or, for that matter, much to dance about.   Which is just how Willy Russell, the author of the show's book, music and lyrics, wants it. First produced in London in 1983, \"Blood Brothers\" is a Thatcher-era attack on the British class system that wears its austerity on its sleeve, bourgeois frills be damned. Mr. Russell, the Liverpool-born author of \"Educating Rita\" and \"Shirley Valentine,\" would rather be sincere than slick. His musical has the rough-hewn proletarian flavor of British dramas of the angry-man era of the late 1950's and early 60's, and that authentic chips-with-everything spirit has been transferred to the snug Music Box Theater without any infusions of Broadway glitz.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930426","headline":"Books of The Times; Peering Behind the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas Matter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/26/books/books-of-the-times-peering-behind-the-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-matter.html","abstract":"  The Real Anita Hill The Untold Story By David Brock 438 pages.

Mediate overcame a disastrous double-bogey on the par-5 15th and then had to save pars on the second and third extra holes before sinking a 4-foot putt for his second PGA Tour victory. He closed with a three-under-par 69 yesterday for a four-day total of 281. Elkington matched that figure with a one-over 73.

His 46th Formula One career victory -- and his second this season -- moved the 38-year-old Frenchman within 2 points of leader Ayrton Senna, who did not finish in his McLaren-Ford.

That's possible only if the participants, especially the Palestinians and the Israelis, are now willing to take real risks for peace.  Four months of sterile arguments over Israel's deportation of 400 Hamas militants offer little encouragement on that score. Yet behind-the-scenes diplomacy orchestrated by the Clinton Administration gives some reason for hope.    Taking over from an Administration that got the peace process off to a brilliant start, but then seemed to lose its focus, the Clinton team made reviving the talks a top foreign policy priority.

As only the second full-scale orbiter to be manufactured after the Approach and Landing Test vehicle Enterprise, Columbia retained unique features indicative of its experimental design compared to later orbiters, such as test instrumentation and distinctive black chines. In addition to a heavier fuselage and the retention of an internal airlock throughout its lifetime, these made Columbia the heaviest of the five spacefaring orbiters; around 1,000 kilograms heavier than Challenger and 3,600 kilograms heavier than Endeavour.

The credit insulates the poor from Social Security payroll taxes and, looking ahead, higher energy taxes. It thus acts to untax the poor who work.   But Congress is groping for ways to evade Mr. Clinton's budget shears, and there are rumblings that some members will try to grab money from the tax credit in a desperate attempt to save a favored spending program or knock down tax hikes.

He topped one of the strongest fields in an American tourney by scoring 6 1/2-2 1/2 in the 10-man invitational event and was awarded the $2,000 first prize.   Grigory Kaidanov, a Russian emigre who lives in Lexington, Ky., took second place with 6-3. Joel Benjamin, a Manhattan grandmaster, and Alexander Wojtkiewicz, the current Polish champion, shared third place with 5 1/2-3 1/2. FINAL STANDINGS                 Player   W.   .   D.   Pts.

Indeed, he was the early leader until he lost to Benjamin with two rounds to go. Here is an example of his powerful attacking play, against the Maryland international master Alexander Sherzer in Round 2 on April 14. Sherzer's chief comment was, \"I confronted him with a new move, but he discovered a strong plan against it.\"    The Aberbakh Attack against the King's Indian Defense, 5 Be2 and 6 Bg5, prevents 6 . . . e5 in view of 7 de de 8 Qd8 Rd8 9 Nd5, which wins material. It also retards the development of the white KN to keep the way clear for supporting such thrusts as g4 or h4.   If Black omits 6 . . . h6, as Sherzer does in this game, then, after 6 . . . c5 7 d5 e6 8 Qd2, he is no longer able to drive off the white QB, although he can still slip out of the pin with 8 . . . ed 9 ed Qb6.   Kaidanov's 11 Nh4 is the introduction to a formerly hotly disputed line of play that begins with 11 . . . Ne4 12 Ne4 Be4 13 f3. After 13 . . . Qb2 14 Rc1 Qd2 15 Kd2 Bd5 (15 . . . Bf5 16 Nf5 gf 17 Bd3 leaves Black in a poor endgame) 16 cd Re8 17 Rb1 Re5 18 f4 Rd5 19 Kc1 Nc6 20 Rb7 Rd4 21 Bf3 d5 22 Rd1 Rd1 23 Kd1, the consensus indicated by the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings, Vol. E, second edition is that White enjoys considerable advantage. For example, 23 . . . h6 24 Bd5 hg 25 Bf7 Kh7 26 Bg6 Kh6 27 fg Kg5 28 Rg7 will win for White.   Sherzer said: \"It was to avoid such trouble that I thought up 11 . . . Bg4. This move was not wrong. My mistakes came later.\" Kaidanov proceeded aggressively with 12 f3 Bc8 13 O-O-O!?   Sherzer said: \"The error was 17 . . . f5, opening my own king position. I should have played 17 . . . Ne5 at once.\" That way, on 18 h4, he would have been able to counterattack with 18 . . . Qb4 19 b3 b5 with reasonable chances of success.   Sherzer did indeed have counterattack in mind when he played 17 . . . f5 18 h4 fg 19 fg Ne5, but Kaidanov's attack with 20 h5! came more swiftly than he had reckoned on. After 20 . . . Rf2, Kaidanov charged to the attack with 21 hg!, ready to give up his knight with 21 . . . Rg2 to smash through with 22 Qh6! hg 23 Qh8 Kf7 24 Rh7 Kf6 25 Qg7 Kg5 26 Qh6 Kf6 27 Ne4 mate.   Sherzer had relied on keeping his opponent tied down after 21 . . . Nc4, but Kaidanov sharply broke loose with 22 gh Kh8 23 Nh4!, threatening 24 Ng6 mate. Sherzer could not play 23 . . . Kh7 because of 24 Bd3, picking up a rook, so he tried 23 . . . Nh5. But after 24 Ng6 Kh7 25 Rh5 Kg8, Kaidanov produced the annihilating 26 Na4!   On 26 . . . Qb5, there would have followed 27 Qh6 Kf7 28 Qh7 Kf6 29 Qe7 Kg6 30 Rg5 Kh6 31 Qg7 mate. But also after 26 . . . Nd2 27 Nb6 Re2 28 Na8, Sherzer had no way of putting up a fight, 28 . . . Bg4 meaning nothing after 29 Rg5. Thus, he gave up.   In last week's column, the diagram should have shown the black king at h8 and a black pawn at f5.
