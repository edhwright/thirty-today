And its budget shortfall is just one reminder that after two years of clamor about how the credit crunch has hurt the economy, there is not a cohesive Federal program to address the issue.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Business Day"},{"date":"19921215","headline":"Raiders' Allen Irked at Davis","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/15/sports/pro-football-raiders-allen-irked-at-davis.html","abstract":"  Marcus Allen, the Los Angeles Raiders' disgruntled running back, last night accused the Raiders' general partner, Al Davis, of orchestrating a campaign to \"ruin my career\" by limiting the 11-year veteran's playing time.

It is a tool for making a political statement.   The arena? The holiday party.   You have cooked up something special, let's say your famous, lighter-than-air Solstice cookies. It's the pride of your kitchen, a secret recipe you've honed to perfection. You bring a batch to a party and your fellow-revelers are in hog heaven. Everything is merry until you find yourself cornered by someone preaching Recipe Socialism: share your secret or be branded Capitalist Running Dog.   Now, you mustn't admit that you don't want to give away your recipe because it's    yours    and you're entitled to it. That smacks of respect for private property and the subversive conceit that you deserve what you earn by the sweat of your brow. But if you try to be honest, your fellow traveler friend (eager to lay hands on undeserved gain) is apt to accuse you of lacking the holiday spirit.   Don't argue. Just clip out the following recipe (note how convincingly we've matched the layout of recipes in The Living Section), and present it to the pastry panhandler. Holiday Puffs   Total time: 25 minutes  1 egg  1/2 cup buttermilk (or 1/4 cup milk mixed with 1/4 cup vinegar)  5 teaspoons baking soda  1/2 teaspoon vanilla  1 cup lemon juice (fresh is best)  1/2 cup sugar  3/8 cup all-purpose flour   1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter a cookie sheet.   2. In a small bowl or 2-cup measuring cup, beat the egg until foamy.   3. Add the buttermilk and the vanilla and blend well.   4. Add the baking soda, one teaspoon at a time, sprinkling it in and beating until the mixture is smooth and the consistency of light cream.   5. Add the lemon juice all at once. Stir gently until blended, but do not beat (it is important not to allow air to get trapped in the mixture).   6. Sift the sugar and the flour together in a small bowl and add it to the egg mixture a teaspoon at a time. Stir until just moistened.   7. Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls, one inch apart, onto the buttered cookie sheet.   8. Bake for 12 minutes or until golden. Serve hot.     Yield: 12 servings     Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 62 calories, 1 gram fat, 10 milligrams cholesterol, 2 milligrams sodium, 4 grams protein, 4 grams carbohydrate.    Then rest secure in the knowledge that when your pantry pinko reaches Step 5, about a gallon of lemon-egg foam will gush out of the measuring cup and inundate the kitchen counter. It's harmless, just lemon juice liberating the carbonate radical of the sodium bicarbonate to produce a cascade of CO2 bubbles -- no fires and, regrettably, no explosions. But plenty messy and more than enough to make Chef Share-the-Wealth crazy.   A ruling-class lackey like yourself may want to photocopy and distribute this recipe to all the bleeding hearts at the party. Or add a touch of verisimilitude by writing it out on a file card, dipping it in weak tea to age the paper and leaving it out as freeloader flypaper. And if nobody's trying to mooch a recipe from you, no need to feel left out. Be an anarchist: slip the recipe into someone else's fax machine (it's a virus) and use the auto dialer to send little bundles of holiday chaos all 'round the world.

The play itself centers on the patient, a middle-aged man with a troubled marriage and family life who is having an affair with a younger woman, the doctor's daughter, who also happens to be an orthopedist.   \"I think it has resonance for people in my age bracket; I'm 53,\" Mr. Tarses said of the play, the first he has ever written after a substantial career in television. Like Al Kirkland, the central character, Mr. Tarses is a Baltimorean, recalls fondly the great Baltimore Oriole teams of the 1960's, has two daughters and has lately had some back problems. But firmly, seriously, without flashing the wide, wicked smile that lets you know he's putting you on, something he's fond of doing, he added: \"But this is not autobiographical in any way.\" TV Shows Beloved, by Some    Mr. Tarses is a somewhat renowned television iconoclast; that is, he's not renowned enough to be a hit maker. His comedies -- \"Buffalo Bill,\" \"The Slap Maxwell Story\" and, most notably, \"The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd\" -- have been fiercely loved (though not by enough people), all of them funny in a way that's a bit darker, a bit more absurd than network television can comfortably accommodate for long.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19921215","headline":"G.M.

Myths like this live partly because they are malleable. So when Craig Lucas (words) and Gerald Busby (music) deposit the Orpheus myth in the midst of music students at an American community college, minor adjustments make it fit. Tinkering with the ending of this story is an old operatic tradition anyway. The one for \"Orpheus in Love,\" which opened last night at the Circle Repertory Company, falls between happy and unhappy.

James Tobin  Nobel laureate and emeritus professor of economics, Yale University    Is there a case for  [ fiscal ]  stimulus to create the jobs we need by 1996? I think there is.    The labor market is weaker than the unemployment rate suggests, for several reasons. Many workers are involuntarily working short time when they would like to be working full time. As everybody knows, we're experiencing an unusual series of layoffs by businesses, permanent layoffs, not temporary cyclical layoffs.    Why can't the Federal Reserve do this job by itself? Well, we heard about the bank credit crunch yesterday and we see that the Fed has more or less given up on doing anything more to stimulate demand, even though it has 300 basis points left between interest rates, short-term interest rates now and zero. I think maybe the Fed did things so late and so little during the recent downturns that they let the economy and business expectations slip away from their grasp.    That's why I think the country needs some fiscal stimulus in the short run. I would be willing to see something like 1 percent of G.D.P. stimulus, which would be about $60 billion a year, and for a couple of years. Other people may prefer a smaller amount.    Now fiscal policy for recovery is bound to raise the deficit temporarily. And we're fooling ourselves if we think there's a way of having a fiscal stimulus that doesn't have that result.    The thing to do, I believe, is to combine the short-run fiscal stimulus with credible deficit reduction policies that will be phased in at a later time, so far as possible enacted, so that they will come into effect at a later time, whether they're tax increases or expenditure reductions.    In today's weak economy, fiscal austerity would be counterproductive and would actually reduce investment in plant and equipment, in technology and human capital for the future. So it actually would damage the prospects of our children and grandchildren, rather than improving them.  Allen Sinai  Chief economist, Boston Company    Short run, a modest dose of net fiscal stimulus probably is necessary to lift growth and jobs as part of the task of raising potential growth in the long run, as well as to sustain a fledgling business expansion. A $20 billion to $30 billion program of short-run fiscal stimulus I believe should be ready to go, legislated as needed in early 1993.    The measures used in this fiscal stimulus I think should . . . do double duty in the sense of being measures that lift short-run growth in jobs but also raise long-run potential output. Candidates . . . include infrastructure spending on roads, highways, buildings, airports, rail and telecommunications and equipment investment tax credits.   Investment tax credits would produce the greatest bang for a buck if they were targeted towards productive equipment, incremental and refundable. Other possibilities: measures such as inflation indexing of capital gains, R.& D. tax credits, education and manpower training programs and incentives for small business.    A major effort should be made to find measures that can raise growth without raising the Federal budget deficit. Some possibilities include an easier bank regulatory environment for bank lending to improve growth at little cost to the budget, a shift in the composition of Treasury financing further away from long-term issues to reduce interest costs of Federal Government financing and greater efficiencies and reduced costs for the provision and delivery of health care services.   On timing, you should do it right away and  [ make it ]  retroactive . . . to early December. I think the impact would be in the second through the fourth quarter of next year when the current impulse of the economy may indeed be fading and so it would come at the right time. If you wait longer, it's dangerous.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19921216","headline":"Mr. Gaidar Departs, Democratically","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/16/opinion/mr-gaidar-departs-democratically.html","abstract":"  It's tempting to interpret the resignation of Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar of Russia as a startling rebuke to Boris Yeltsin and his program of radical economic reform. Yet even with the more- cautious apparatchik Viktor Chernomyrdin in the job, reform could still go forward, though at a slower pace and on a different trajectory. And though the infighting was brutal, the result was reached democratically.   That reaffirms the wisdom of not imposing a made-in-America brand of economic policy as the test for all United States aid to Russia.

He seemed to take on the persona of each song, becoming the young lover, the worshipful son, the wizened wanderer. In \"Alinde\" he presented an eerie Romantic drama of dialogue and yearning. In \"Der Schiffer\" -- \"The Boatman\" -- his voice seemed to embody animal energy, the recurring accents suggesting the repeated swell of waves. \"Die Allmacht\" -- a paean to the power of Jehovah -- had the authority and wonder of authentic faith.

It boasts a music room whose ceiling was painted by Jose Maria Sert and a so-called ivory room that displays an extraordinary collection of ivory artifacts.

Only the most obviously disreputable of American imports and revivals fail to earn critical raves here, and on occasion local versions of New York shows are proclaimed superior to the originals. During the 1980's, this was most famously the case with Richard Eyre's staging of \"Guys and Dolls\" and Cameron Mackintosh's upbeat revision of Stephen Sondheim's \"Follies,\" though American visitors could see that both productions were far from fluent in Broadwayese. In \"Guys and Dolls,\" Damon Runyon's mugs sometimes spoke with Southern accents and tapped like Bojangles.   So it was with skepticism that I approached the new production of the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein \"Carousel,\" which opened last weekend to ecstatic reviews and turn-away crowds at the Royal National Theater, the site of the Eyre \"Guys and Dolls.\" But for once the wild enthusiasm may be an understatement. This is without question the most revelatory, not to mention the most moving, revival I've seen of any Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. The National has recently found startling new ways of looking at the dramas of Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller under both Peter Hall's and Mr. Eyre's leadership, and now it proves just as imaginative in sweeping away decades of cliches from an American musical classic of the same period.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19921217","headline":"Brace the Coffee Table (or Make a New One Out of a Big Book)","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/17/garden/brace-the-coffee-table-or-make-a-new-one-out-of-a-big-book-485592.html","abstract":"  AMERICA'S PAINTED LADIES: THE ULTIMATE CELEBRATION OF OUR VICTORIANS , by Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen;, photographs by Douglas Keister (Dutton; $40).

Dil had to be, among other things, poised, photogenic, black, extremely changeable and able to carry off the sleight-of-hand on which one of the film's secrets depends. In short, Dil had to be an actress with a difference.   Many people, Stanley Kubrick among them, warned Mr. Jordan he would never find the right performer for the part. Some even suggested the film could not be made. But hundreds of hopefuls auditioned to play Dil, while casting assistants combed London. The only diffident candidate was Jaye Davidson, who had friends in the film world and was spotted at a wrap party for Derek Jarman's \"Edward II.\" That very night, an invitation to try out for the role was offered.
