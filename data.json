traveled into the heart of a largely unmapped landscape: the human genome, the tightly wound coils of DNA that form each one of us. \n\n     Laid end to end, the coils would form a strand six feet long, bearing data that could fill 13 sets of encyclopedias. Along this strand, only random stretches of DNA, maybe 5 percent of the entire genome, are known to be engaged  in the intricate processes that shape our existence. These isolated DNA bits are the genes.
