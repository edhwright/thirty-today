Using only drones, drumming and melodic lines (traded between the voice and a tar, tanbur or setar, long-necked fretted lutes that twang like Appalachian dulcimers), the pieces create a transparent framework for impassioned singing and meticulous improvisation.    The program's three segments were all suitelike groups of melodies: urban semi-classical music and Kurdish folk music bracketing a Persian classical avaz, a traditional sequence of vocal and instrumental tunes. All evolved from sustained, improvisational introductions to melodies backed by a regular beat, with shorter, simpler tunes in the folk and urban music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930130","headline":"Luverly Role for a Broadway Novice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/30/theater/luverly-role-for-a-broadway-novice.html","abstract":"  This is a Cinderella story about a Cinderella story.

He made an impression. Both his performance and his calm resourcefulness in facing down a rancorous claque of anti-Dreyfusards were the talk of the town and its press for weeks. (Even some Frenchmen who disapproved of Dreyfus's conviction resented a foreigner's pronouncements on the issue. Debussy wrote a regrettably sarcastic review of Grieg's concert -- but made amends in later years.)   Every biography of the great Norwegian composer records this eventually triumphal return to Paris, but none that I know mentions the most important thing, from posterity's point of view, that he did while he was there: on May 2, he visited the studios of the Gramophone and Typewriter Company and recorded about a quarter-hour's worth of his piano music on nine 10-inch wax masters.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930131","headline":"Who's on First?

Although Noodle on One has flaws, the restaurant clearly values innovation and is working on it, and in any case there are dishes certainly good enough right now to please every taste.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930131","headline":"Ellen O'Toole, J.

If ordered they will obey, or rather their successors will obey, since the objections of the Joint Chiefs will probably lead many to resign to protest a policy that will lead to a degradation of our country's military capabilities.   As a former marine officer and company commander who served in the 1980's, I had some opportunity to observe the dynamics of creating an effective fighting force. The Joint Chiefs do not oppose homosexual integration because of an innate dislike of homosexuals; I suspect they have gay friends and relatives, as most of us do.

Even without one blade of grass, a single bench or a cast-iron lamppost, the city's scrappy strip of shoreline is a ribbon park where people come to soak up the incandescent air of light reflected over water.   Manhattan's newest park is a neat little bow stitched into this tattered ribbon. New Yorkers are familiar with look-in parks, those fenced-in plots of green that people can peer into but not enter. Morton Street Park is a look-out park, a place for gazing at the sky. It is also a vantage point for peering into the future.

In a text that fills almost 1,200 pages, Marguerite Young explores the nature of Miss MacIntosh, a drowned elderly governess whose exterior was artifice (she wore a wig and a false breast) and whose interior world remains a mystery. Vera Cartwheel, who was cared for by Miss MacIntosh in her childhood, narrates the novel, whose Joycean monologues and stream-of-consciousness prose created a literary sensation when it was first published in 1965. Our reviewer, William Goyen, called the book \"a mammoth epic, a massive fable, a picaresque journey, a Faustian quest and a work of stunning magnitude and beauty.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930131","headline":"Carl Bettag, Susannah Roberts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/31/style/engagements-carl-bettag-susannah-roberts.html","abstract":"  Dr. John M.

We may have rolled our eyes, but we certainly knew what he meant. Audrey Hepburn, who died on Jan. 20 at the age of 63, was the embodiment of grace, generosity and kindness, a performer who filled the screen with entrancing light. With her passing, the cinema lost more than a well-loved actress: it lost a swan.   There is a deeper than usual sadness associated with the death of this particular star. Audrey Hepburn charmed audiences in unexpected ways, and she set a standard of beauty that touched an entire generation. Like her contemporary, Grace Kelly, she radiated the sort of hothouse loveliness that could not have been manufactured by Hollywood's star-making apparatus. What's more, she softened her regal manner with glacier-melting warmth. \"I myself was born with an enormous need for affection and a terrible need to give it,\" she told Alan Riding of The New York Times in 1991, on the eve of her being honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. \"That's what I'd like to think maybe has been the appeal.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930131","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/31/movies/c-corrections-942193.html","abstract":"  An article on Jan. 10 about film roles for women misstated the eligibility rules for Academy Award nominations.

Styles in Beethoven interpretation changed with the styles of composition, from Schumann and Berlioz to Wagner to Mahler to Boulez.

In books like \"The Gold Coast\" (1988) and \"Pacific Edge\" (1990) he virtually invented a new kind of science fiction, in which characters as richly drawn as any in conventional fiction inhabit near-future worlds evoked with as much verisimilitude as the contemporary settings of any conventional novel. This is even more difficult than it sounds. Just how difficult can be seen in Mr. Robinson's RED MARS (Spectra/Bantam, cloth, $22.95; paper, $11.95).    As always, Mr. Robinson is admirably ambitious; this 519-page novel is the first of a projected trilogy about the colonization of Mars. In the last decade or so, space probes and other forms of scientific surveillance have greatly extended our knowledge of Earth's second-nearest neighbor in the solar system. The Mars of earlier science fiction -- the Mars of H. G. Wells or Edgar Rice Burroughs or Ray Bradbury -- has been relegated to myth and fantasy. Without having set foot on Mars, we know a great deal about the atmosphere and surface of the planet. Mr. Robinson has thoroughly digested this material and woven it into the fabric of his narrative, which deals with the settlement of Mars by a hundred carefully chosen scientists who fight among themselves over the future of the planet, only to see all their visions overwhelmed by the needs and greed of later settlers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930131","headline":"Of Fresh Fish And Trends","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/31/style/the-night-of-fresh-fish-and-trends.html","abstract":"  LAST Tuesday, there were only two places in Manhattan where you could have bought a piece of fresh line-caught Alaskan king salmon -- Balducci's market in Greenwich Village or Docks, a seafood restaurant on the Upper West Side.

Although its purpose is often nothing more than to be a visual prank, caricature at its best has often been an acerbic and accessible form of social and political criticism. In THE SAVAGE MIRROR: The Art of Contemporary Caricature (Watson-Guptil, paper, $29.95), Steven Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, and Gail Anderson, the deputy art director of Rolling Stone, present an overview of contemporary caricature, tracing its evolution from 19th-century France through its powerful resurgence in the United States from the mid-1950's to the mid-1970's. The authors explain the roles that editorial preferences, design fads and technology have played in creating the current scene, which they seem, almost in spite of themselves, to find disappointing. For Ms. Anderson and Mr. Heller, caricaturists have great power -- and perhaps even a duty -- to address the issues of the day, to use their skills to rouse the public. Today the subjects of caricature are less likely to be political figures than celebrities, who menace our sensibilities more than our freedom. As the book amply illustrates, in changing from pen to airbrush, caricature has gone from inspired anger to dextrous hipness. Ms. Anderson and Mr. Heller clearly believe that a caricature should communicate an idea; as they survey contemporary caricature, they see \"little gems of mild distortion\" rather than a savage mirror that confronts society with its sorry reflection. This profusely illustrated book provides an excellent introduction to its subject, and the authors are persuasive in their arguments for the importance of caricature.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930131","headline":"Gerald Weiss and Melanie Haber","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/31/style/engagements-gerald-weiss-and-melanie-haber.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Alan W.

The raiders moved swiftly from house to house, breaking into some, setting fire to others. \"At length they came and beset our own House, and quickly it was the dolefullest day that ever mine eyes saw,\" Mary White Rowlandson later recorded. \"Some in our House were fighting for their Lives, others wallowing in their Blood; the House on fire over our Heads, and the bloody Heathen ready to knock us on the Head if we stirred out.\"\n\nBy midafternoon, at least a dozen settlers had been killed and 24 taken captive, Rowlandson among them. Also captured were her three children -- her son, Joseph, then 14, and two daughters, 10-year-old Mary and 6-year-old Sarah (who had been wounded in the raid and died a week later in her mother's arms). Rowlandson, separated from her two oldest children immediately after her capture, was given into the care of a Narragansett warrior and his wife.

According to this criterion, the science-fiction series that have proliferated on television this season -- \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,\" \"Space Rangers\" and \"Time Trax\" -- fall short. Instead of representing an evolutionary step forward from the \"Star Trek\" era, which began 26 years ago with the first voyage of the starship Enterprise and is still going strong with \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" the new shows prompt a sense of deja vu. Inside their futuristic packaging they offer familiar premises and plots mostly borrowed from past television shows and movies.    For all its public resolve to be grittier and sexier than its forebears, \"Deep Space Nine,\" launched this month with a two-hour special (its regular time slot is 7 P.M. Sundays on Channel 11 in New York), comes across as no more than a \"Star Trek\" spinoff, set in a seedy 24th-century space station instead of a spotless starship. \"Space Rangers,\" which began on CBS this month and is seen at 8 P.M. Wednesdays, offers 22d-century space cops in a higher-tech, lower-brow \"Mission: Impossible\" laced with secondhand \"Aliens.\" \"Babylon 5,\" a syndicated movie to be broadcast in late February, features yet another space station filled with touchy humans and nonhumans with funny faces and hairdos. \"Time Trax, \" a syndicated hourlong series (8 P.M.

In books like \"The Gold Coast\" (1988) and \"Pacific Edge\" (1990) he virtually invented a new kind of science fiction, in which characters as richly drawn as any in conventional fiction inhabit near-future worlds evoked with as much verisimilitude as the contemporary settings of any conventional novel. This is even more difficult than it sounds. Just how difficult can be seen in Mr. Robinson's RED MARS (Spectra/Bantam, cloth, $22.95; paper, $11.95).    As always, Mr. Robinson is admirably ambitious; this 519-page novel is the first of a projected trilogy about the colonization of Mars. In the last decade or so, space probes and other forms of scientific surveillance have greatly extended our knowledge of Earth's second-nearest neighbor in the solar system. The Mars of earlier science fiction -- the Mars of H. G. Wells or Edgar Rice Burroughs or Ray Bradbury -- has been relegated to myth and fantasy. Without having set foot on Mars, we know a great deal about the atmosphere and surface of the planet. Mr. Robinson has thoroughly digested this material and woven it into the fabric of his narrative, which deals with the settlement of Mars by a hundred carefully chosen scientists who fight among themselves over the future of the planet, only to see all their visions overwhelmed by the needs and greed of later settlers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930131","headline":"Hawaii Expects Tourism Slump To Continue","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/31/travel/travel-advisory-hawaii-expects-tourism-slump-to-continue.html","abstract":"  Hawaii's tourism industry is expected to struggle again this year, with the number of visitors forecast to grow only slightly at best, or perhaps even to drop, according to predictions from two sources.

He does not mention that having a fake Social Security card to illegally get a job is a crime.

Starting with an assumed name that evokes the king of rock-and-roll himself, Costello has spent much of his career exploring ways of merging his dour, post-punk point of view with grander, more traditional musical forms without compromising his anti-establishment image. And on his new album, \"The Juliet Letters\" (Warner Brothers 45180-2; CD and cassette), recorded with the Brodsky Quartet, a well-regarded English string ensemble, the tug between his \"higher\" aspirations and his scrappy roots has reached a new degree of tautness.    \"The Juliet Letters\" is a suite of 20 songs -- three of them instrumentals -- that the 38-year-old Costello created collaboratively with the quartet, whose members are in their early 30's. Recorded like a classical chamber music album, without overdubs, the record is a fascinating study in aural contrasts that takes some getting used to.  Against the ensemble's sumptuous playing, Costello's stringy voice, with its choked intonation and sarcastic undertone, sounds like the wrong instrument for the right record.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930131","time":"1993-01-31

Only a few years ago, audiences and judges at the nation's major showcase for independent films embraced arty, esoteric movies and snubbed those dreaded Hollywood-style products. But the increasing influx of the Hollywood crowd -- coupled with changing styles of film makers -- was evident on Saturday night when audience awards were presented to films that are -- let's face it -- mainstream.   \"El Mariachi,\" a comedy-drama by Richard Rodriguez, a 24-year-old Texas film maker, won the Audience Award for a feature film, which is given on a vote by the festival's 5,000 filmgoers and is a good gauge of a film's commercial prospects. The film, about a mariachi musician who enters a Mexican border town at the same time as a hit man, was made by Mr. Rodriguez and his friends for only $7,000. Initially made as a quickie for the Spanish-language video market, it is about as arty as \"Lethal Weapon.\" But much funnier.   (Not as funny, and overlooked in the awards, but still the most talked about film, was \"Boxing Helena,\" about obsessive love gone haywire. Audiences reacted in two ways: they loved it or they hated it.)   Mr. Rodriguez, an engaging, coolly confident film maker whose movie is to be released by Columbia Pictures in January, said on Saturday night, \"I just hope this inspires people to make their own movies, no matter who they are, no matter how rich or poor.\" A Winning Documentary    The Audience Award for a documentary was given to \"Something Within Me,\" an affectionate portrait of St. Augustine's School of the Arts in the South Bronx. This unusual elementary school uses music and other forms of artistic expression to nurture a sense of responsibility and pride among its poor, minority students. The movie won two other awards: the Film Makers Trophy and a Special Jury Award for Merit.   The documentary's producer, Jerret Engle, a former editor at the Dutton publishing house, initially heard about the school on the evening news in New York City about five years ago. Since then, she has worked at part-time jobs and spent years raising $250,000 to make the film.   \"I'm just floored,\" she said on Saturday night. \"I love these kids and their teachers, but I didn't know anyone else would be interested.\" The film, set for a modest commercial release, has already drawn the interest of the Public Broadcasting Service and Home Box Office. Four Grand Prizes    In presenting the awards, the audience was somewhat out of sync with the more traditional Sundance jury. The panel split the Grand Jury prizes among two dramas and two documentaries.   The dramas are \"Ruby in Paradise,\" Victor Nunez's rambling film about a young woman who flees her Tennessee town to find her sense of self on the Florida coast, and Bryan J. Singer's \"Public Access.\" The latter is about a slick, slightly eerie newcomer to a fictional Midwestern town, Brewster, who takes over the public-access cable network and asks the question: \"What's wrong with Brewster?\" The result is nothing less than paranoia.   The jury's documentary awards were given to two powerful works: \"Children of Fate: Life and Death in a Sicilian Family,\" a heart-wrenching portrait of three generations of a Sicilian family, and \"Silverlake Life: The View From Here,\" a harrowing film about AIDS.   (Other prize-winners included Steve Gomer's \"Fly By Night,\" a drama about New York rappers; Tony Chan's \"Combination Platter,\" about illegal Chinese immigrants; Everett Lewis's \"Ambush of Ghosts,\" about a dysfunctional family; Leslie Harris's \"Just Another Girl on the IRT,\" about a black Brooklyn teen-ager, and \"Lillian,\" about the struggles of a black woman. A documentary prize also went to \"Earth and the American Dream,\" about the destruction of the nation's environment).   \"Silverlake Life\" traces the final journey of a film teacher, Tom Joslin, and his companion of 22 years, Mark Maasi, both of whom had AIDS. The two men lived in the Silverlake area of Los Angeles, and both videotaped the film themselves. The graphic film, which includes a hard-to-watch death scene, was completed by a friend, Peter Friedman, a documentary director.   Mr. Friedman, 34, a former student of Mr. Joslin's at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., said he culled 40 hours of videotapes to produce the 99-minute film. \"It is a direct and a difficult film which shows the realities of day-to-day life with AIDS,\" Mr. Friedman said after the awards. \"The whole spirit of the film is to confront the pain and the love shared by these two men.\" In recent days, he said, television and theatrical distributors have expressed interest in the documentary. A Few Words From the Founder    Sundance is plainly going a bit Hollywood; at least six agents from United Talent Agency, one of the festival's numerous sponsors and more aggressive agencies, were seeking new clients. Still, the awards ceremony hardly resembled the Oscars.   Robert Redford, the founder of the festival, was welcomed onstage with applause and whistles. He wore boots, jeans, a leather jacket and a striped sweat shirt.   Mr. Redford, one of the few millionaire movie stars who have actually paid back the industry by nurturing new film makers, told the packed crowd in a converted basketball gym in this ski resort town: \"Nobody can understand the blood, the sweat, the dedication it takes to make these films. Nobody can understand that except the film maker.\"   He said the festival stands for \"innovation, for the avant-garde.\" But other film makers and executives say it was virtually unavoidable for Sundance to turn, unwittingly, into a hunting ground for Hollywood. In many ways, Hollywood is less interested in the films shown here -- which often flounder at the box office -- than in new film makers with commercial potential.   \"It really is a festival of agents,\" said Jonathan Dana, the president of Triton Pictures, an independent film company, who has been visiting the festival for several years. \"It's a barter economy. Everyone's trading information. But it's a tricky conversion from the narrow world of independent films to the market place.\"   Mr. Dana speaks from personal experience. Last year, Triton bought two of the big prize-winners at Sundance: the comedy, \"In the Soup,\" whose star, Seymour Cassel, was master of ceremonies at this year's awards, and the documentary \"A Brief History of Time.\"   Mr. Dana, standing outside a movie theater in Park City, said simply, \"One worked; one didn't.\"   Like another big favorite last year, \"The Waterdance,\" \"In the Soup\" failed at the box office. But \"A Brief History\" succeeded. Mr. Dana shrugged and voiced the oft-heard Hollywood complaint: \"Who knows what works?\" 'Orlando' and 'Helena'    Curiously, the two pictures that were most widely discussed at Sundance went unmentioned last night.   One of them, \"Orlando,\" an adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel by an English film maker, Sally Potter, had its United States premiere at the festival but was not in competition for prizes. (The festival divides films into two major categories, those in competition and those having premieres.) By virtual consensus, \"Orlando\" was the most dazzling film at the festival.   And then there was \"Boxing Helena.\"   No film at the festival provoked as much rage, hisses, applause and debate as this one. The film was directed and written by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, the daughter of David Lynch. Even before it was shown here, the movie created an unusual amount of talk because of the last-minute withdrawals of Madonna and then Kim Basinger from the lead role. Helena is now played by Sherilyn Fenn.   The film deals with a lunatic surgeon (Julian Sands) obsessed by an elusive, beautiful woman named Helena. To keep her, he transforms her into his own Venus de Milo by cutting off her arms and legs and placing her on a pedestal. Hard to believe, but the film is a comedy, albeit very dark.   Ms. Lynch, like many of the twentysomething directors here, is a very confident, assured film maker, without a hint of self-doubt.   Sipping coffee and chain-smoking the other morning in a hotel dining room, Ms. Lynch said she was startled by the almost violent reaction to her film. The film has been called anti-feminist, anti-male and exploitative.   \"People want the film abolished,\" she said. \"They scream at us. I wish they would talk to me. I want to hear them. They don't want to have a discussion. They just get up and leave.\"   Ms. Lynch, who never went to college, grew up in Los Angeles and attended Interlochen Arts Academy in Interlochen, Mich. Upon graduation, she said, she went on a \"fairly extensive hike with my boyfriend,\" lived in Baltimore for several months, and then moved to Los Angeles at 19 to work for her father and write the movie. She's now 24. The movie is awaiting a distributor in the United States   \"My whole intent was to parody and to show seriously what we do to each other in relationships,\" she said. \"It's about how we try to change each other. We are equally vulnerable to self-hatred, to obsession, and we try and change each other. It's about how we try to break each other down and control each other -- the thievery that goes on in obsessive relationships.\"   Although other film makers here find it hard to believe, Ms. Lynch said being her father's daughter was not a blessing.   \"Believe me, people wanted nothing to do with me,\" she said. \"I was 19; it was a risky script; I was some big director's daughter and female. There's something about being a daughter. You would think it gives you some credibility. It doesn't.\"   At least, Ms. Lynch had no trouble getting through the doors of agents and executives. A Long Island Story    At the other end of the spectrum is Rob Weiss, 26, whose father, Carl, runs a touring business for gamblers in Cedarhurst, L.I. To raise money for his son's film, \"Amongst Friends,\" which turned out to be one of the strongest at the festival, Mr. Weiss sent out letters to his customers.   Rob Weiss, who wears his cap backwards and speaks with an unmistakable New York accent, said: \"My dad's friends are pretty much high rollers. The letter wasn't done in a schlock manner. It was classy. It said, like: 'Hey, if you're going to bet on ball games your entire life, if you're going to bet on horses, do something good with the money for a change. Bet it on the kid.\"   The bet on the kid seems to be paying off.   The movie is a gritty exploration of a group of wealthy high-school graduates, most of them Jewish or Italian, from the Five Towns of Long Island who drift into boredom, drugs, petty crime and tragedy. The director, who grew up on Long Island and attended the Parsons School of Design for about a year, said this was the world in which he grew up. Mr. Weiss said he owed a great deal to the works of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Oliver Stone. He said he had seen Phillip Kaufman's \"Wanderers,\" about 40 times. (Mr. Kaufman was honored at this year's Sundance Film Festival.)   Mr. Weiss now has an agent, a lawyer, a manager and a publicity agent. Studios are beckoning. But he's not going Hollywood, he insisted. \"You've got to know where you came from,\" he said. \"I live in South-Central L.A., by U.S.C., with my girlfriend. The neighborhood is predominantly African-American and Mexican. It's reality. That's what I want. That's what I need. Nothing's going to change.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930201","headline":"A River Runs Through Courier's Victory in Australia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/01/sports/tennis-a-river-runs-through-courier-s-victory-in-australia.html","abstract":"  Jim Courier was running for the river, running toward a repeat of last year's victory swim with his coach and high-energy soulmate, Brad Stine.

Mitchell, the majority leader, proposed anything really radical, like requiring amendments to have something to do with the bill they amend, or even something painful, like a five-day, or even a four-day week.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930201","headline":"Results Plus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/01/sports/results-plus-219093.html","abstract":"  N.H.L.

But traditions build themselves, inevitably, through formal repetition and paternal influence. Today's bands bear traces of the Stones, Led Zeppelin or the Clash, because those groups created the family language. To escape their parents, today's rockers have to run a very long way from home. Or they can redecorate the old haunts in colors meant to disturb and dislocate their esthetic elders.   Two groups who played at Irving Plaza on Wednesday night took this approach. The evening's headliner, Ween, wrings the neck of rock's power-tripping machismo by playing arena anthems without the arena or even a full band. The pseudonymous duo of Dean and Gene Ween writes memorable pop tunes and play and sings them with verve and skill. But with nothing but a bank of tapes supporting Dean's lone guitar and Gene's metal-playboy vocals, the group's mock pomposity constantly collapses back upon itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930201","headline":"1 Messier Out, 1 Messier Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/01/sports/hockey-1-messier-out-1-messier-up.html","abstract":"  The Rangers don't know if Mark Messier's injured wrist will be recovered enough for him to play against the Islanders at Nassau Coliseum tonight.

But Luciano Berio has chosen a peculiar relationship to tradition, as could be heard on Friday night, when Dennis Russell Davies led the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in an impressively played concert devoted to Mr. Berio's music. The concert, which was repeated on Saturday night, suggested how much Mr. Berio's avant-garde stance, during more than three decades of composition, has involved wrestling with the past, both in rejecting it and in absorbing it.    Often, the past is something definitely to avoid. Mr. Berio was attracted to the experimental music of the 1950's and was a pioneer of electronic music. Then he produced works like \"Sinfonia,\" whose subject was the countercultural politics of the 1960s. He pushed solo instruments to their limits in a series of numbered works, each titled \"Sequenza,\" and has combined rigorous musical construction with dramatic textual settings. Mr. Berio, who has taught at Juilliard and has been an influential participant in Ircam, Pierre Boulez's research institute for new music in Paris, has written music that is aggressive, distinctive and difficult to like. He has often gone out of his way to write in a perpetual present rather than a traditional past, his eyes focused on \"advanced\" technique.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930201","headline":"Iran's Leader Challenges U.S. And Talks of Re-election Bid","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/01/world/iran-s-leader-challenges-us-and-talks-of-re-election-bid.html","abstract":"  President Hashemi Rafsanjani confirmed today that he was ready to run for a second term in June and warned the Clinton Administration in unusually dismissive terms that it was up to Washington to improve relations with his country.
