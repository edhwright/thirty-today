When we decided to take a cruise last summer to the Norwegian Arctic I packed my swimsuit but didn't really anticipated swimming in 35-degree water 567 miles south of the North Pole. But plummet into frigid seas we did, along with 10 other hearty and slightly crazy souls who delighted in a quick dip in waters hospitable to polar bears, walruses and icebergs.   Our plunge took place near Spitsbergen, in the Svalbard archipelago, a group of islands covering 23,000 square miles (half of which is perpetually covered with ice) that is so far north -- 1,000 miles above the Arctic Circle -- that it is seldom visited by tourists. We chose this destination because of its remoteness and the chance to see polar bears and pelagic birds in their natural habitats. To our delight we got an unparalleled view of a polar bear and her cub and saw teems of nesting seabirds -- and because of melting ice and a skillful captain, our ship sailed farther north than it had ever gone before.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Putting Lives Back Together After a Fire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/nyregion/putting-lives-back-together-after-a-fire.html","abstract":"  AFTER fire ravaged a six-story cooperative apartment building here last month, Dean Fausty counted himself among the lucky ones.

But he sailed easily over the bar on his second try at that height and on his first attempt at 19-2 1/4 before asking that the bar be set just above his world-record mark of 20-1 1/4. Last week, Bubka cleared 19-8 1/4 at the Bruce Jenner Classic last week for the highest vault ever on United States soil, but he did not attempt a world record then, waiting instead for the Prefontaine meet.   Both the Prefontaine meet and Bubka are sponsored by Nike. Bubka missed badly on his first world-record try but nearly cleared it on his second, knocking the bar off with his torso on the way down. His third attempt was even closer. He made it all the way over the bar but brushed it with his arms. The bar stayed in place for an instant, then fell. Bubka tied the meet and Hayward Field record set by Kory Tarpenning in 1988. Tarpenning was second yesterday at 18-8 1/4. (AP) Hometown Heroes: Luann Williams, former Clara Barton High School of Brooklyn star now at Odessa (Tex.) Junior College, took both women's sprints yesterday in the Coors/Metropolitan Athletics Congress outdoor track and field championships at St. John's. Williams, the national junior college champion in the 100 and 200 meters, won the 100 in 12 seconds and the 200 in 24.43 seconds yesterday, running for the Caribbean Connection Track Club. She almost lost the 100 when her starting blocks slipped, and she got off poorly. However, Williams made up ground quickly and caught Marissa Maggio of Anderson International at the tape as both were clocked in the same time. Charlene Neptune, Williams's teammate at Clara Barton, Odessa and the Caribbean Connection, finished first in the 1,500 meters in 4 minutes 32.47 seconds. She was second in the 800 meters at 2:10.34 behind Adina Valdez of the Westchester Track Club, who won in 2:06.52. In men's events, Ric Liddie of the Pioneer Club, former Andrew Jackson runner, upset Larry Gardner of Nike Atlantic in the 400 meters with a time of 47.77 seconds.  GOLF  Baker's Lead Is Cut Peter Baker, after shooting an even-par 72, had his three-stroke lead trimmed to one yesterday in the Dunhill British Masters in Woburn, England. Baker, a 25-year-old Briton who vaulted into the lead with a course record-tying 64 on Friday, managed a lone birdie on his third trip over the 6,940-yard Duke's course and was at 13-under 203. That left him just one shot ahead of countryman Carl Mason, Ronan Rafferty of Northern Ireland and Joakim Haeggman of Sweden. Mason and Haeggman shot 69's, and Rafferty, who birdied the last two holes, had a 70 and was at 204. Sandy Lyle, a former Masters titleholder at Augusta, followed his second-round 65 with a 70 and was another stroke off the pace at 205. Bernhard Langer, winner of this year's Masters at Augusta, fell five shots off the lead with a 71. (AP) Title for Florida: Florida won the team championship and Arizona State's Todd Demsey won the individual title at the N.C.A.A. men's tournament in Lexington, Ky., when Georgia Tech's David Duval couldn't par the final hole. Florida, which relinquished the lead to Georgia Tech after the third round and trailed by three strokes heading into the final 18 holes, shot a five-under-par 283 to finish at seven-under 1,145 on the par-72 Champions course. Georgia Tech was one stroke back while North Carolina finished third in the 15-team tournament with a five-under 1,147. Demsey, who had three birdies yesterday in recording a three-under 69, finished with a 10-under 278, while Duval's 70 put him a stroke back in second. The Gators, who also won the tournament in 1968 and 1973, clinched the title when Chris Couch sank a four-foot putt for par on No. 18. The Gators also won the tournament in 1968 and 1973. (AP) SOCCER Bundesliga Decided Bernd Hobsch scored two second-half goals and Werder Bremen shut out VfB Stuttgart, 3-0, yesterday in Berlin to capture the Bundesliga title. Bremen entered the game with the same 18-10-5 record as Bayern Munich, but Munich saw its hopes for a record 13th crown end in a 3-3 draw against Schalke. Bremen, the champion in 1965 and 1988, broke a 0-0 tie when Hobsch fired his first goal in the 46th minute. Thomas Wolter scored four minutes later to make the score 2-0, and Hobsch scored again in the 74th minute. Munich had been in first place since opening day before Bremen took over first last Saturday. Bayer Leverkusen secured a UEFA Cup berth for next season with its 4-0 victory over Monchengladbach.

Other states are looking at Connecticut to see how to handle rabies.\"    Fairfield County is completely saturated with the disease, Litchfield County heavily infected. Other parts of the state west of the Connecticut River are experiencing an upsurge in cases with the spring population boom, according to Dr. LeGeyt.

Though thousands of exposures have been counted nationally, not one case of human rabies has been identified because the post-exposure treatment is so effective, Dr. LeGeyt said.  Ebbs and Flows    The virus ebbs and flows in a cycle that depends on how fast the wildlife re-populates. Cases will decline first in the areas first affected, like Fairfield County.

One sort of food writer assumes that the cook wants and needs to be told what to do in a prescriptive fashion -- make it work, make it beautiful. But from the opposite camp come recipes aimed at some presumably smaller number of cooks who are confident enough and experienced enough to search out the cooking tutors who will simply show them the way and set them free.   Elizabeth David, the British food writer, was renowned for being a cookbook author in the latter camp (the American chef Anne Rosenzweig once said of David's writing: \"Recipes were not recipes; they were ideas\"). More recently, there have been many other strong examples of the approach. Among contemporary books, Shirley King's \"Fish: The Basics\" comes to mind for its willingness to give direction and then trust the cook to do something with it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"TRAVEL;\nArcadia: Last of the Head Trips","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/books/travel-arcadia-last-of-the-head-trips.html","abstract":"THE travel book, like the novel, is a literary genre apparently without rules. Fourteen lines are mandatory in a sonnet, and a tragedy must end with someone's death, but the travel book is free from precept or precedent: it needs only to describe a journey, which writing -- as the movement of language through time -- automatically does. Nevertheless, the best travel books owe a secret allegiance to one of the most ancient literary genres: they all turn out to be versions of pastoral.\n\nPastoral is the form that depicts the paradise we have lost, the rustic simplicity of a good life in a golden age. The pastoral ideal of the classical poets, from Theocritus to Sir Philip Sidney, was irretrievably distant in time. For the travel writer, the idyll is teasingly remote in space, but can be reached by consulting the airline schedules.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Brown Is Late at Start But Early at the Finish","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/sports/rowing-brown-is-late-at-start-but-early-at-the-finish.html","abstract":"  The Brown crew, the men's varsity eight that had hardly been tested this season, was a little casual and a little tardy in reaching the starting line today for the championship race of the Intercollegiate Rowing Association regatta on the Cooper River course.

His flamboyant scenic cantata \"Carmina Burana\" is occasionally performed on pops programs or by ballet companies. His educational ideas, usually adulterated by the Kodaly method or another pedagogical approach, are still applied in schools. But of the considerable breadth of his achievement, there is little representation.   So the budget reissue of the sole studio recording of Orff's quasi-opera \"Antigonae\" (Deutsche Grammophon 437 721-2; three CD's) is of particular interest. Now available by import and set for American release later this year, it can be profitably compared with a newly released historical album of the 1949 world premiere at the Salzburg Festival (Stradivarius STR 10060; two CD's).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Bringing Dinos Back to Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/movies/film-bringing-dinos-back-to-life.html","abstract":"  WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU seeing when a triceratops or a velociraptor appears on screen in \"Jurassic Park\"?

And it's almost true. Bisected by Route 6, Cape Cod's main artery, Eastham appears at first glance to have little of even passing interest, besides a glimpse of water and a vaguely hat-shaped visitor center. To most hurried visitors, \"the gateway\" to the National Seashore, as Eastham is known, remains a stop for gas on the way to the beach; for those who pause a moment longer on their way to Wellfleet or Provincetown, it's a straggle of efficiency cottages, a few motels and a handful of slightly faded roadside attractions. No blown glass, no band concerts, no yacht club.    But for those who linger, Eastham provides its own quiet blandishments. The sun rises over the ocean on one edge of town, and sets a few miles away over Cape Cod Bay. In between sunrise and sunset, you can swim across a couple of freshwater ponds, or brood by a salt marsh. A watery, drifting place, Eastham loses a bit of itself every year to the tides, shored up only by beach grass and scrub pine. Where the ground isn't spongy, it's sandy. Long ago, I decided that this tentative quality must be why Eastham has stayed so unassuming, blessedly free of choked harbors, of restaurants that treat lobster as haute cuisine, of golf courses larger than half an acre. Instead it's a mom-and-pop kind of town; the same family has always owned the general store, and a rented bicycle comes with a desultory chat about back roads, and a reminder to wear a helmet. When you spot someone wearing Spandex on the bike path, you know he's ridden in from somewhere else.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Brown, a Free Agent, Wants to Stay Put","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/sports/sports-people-football-brown-a-free-agent-wants-to-stay-put.html","abstract":"  Bengals wide receiver EDDIE BROWN, just granted free-agent status, says he'll consider remaining in Cincinnati.   \"Cincinnati is still in my heart,\" Brown said Friday after an arbitrator made him a free agent, ruling that an injury to his neck was football-related.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Car Aromas Fit for a King","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/style/thing-car-aromas-fit-for-a-king.html","abstract":"  WHAT: A 5-inch-high, 3 1/2-inch wide, gold-painted plastic air freshener in the shape of an eight-pointed crown topped with a cross.

Westchester has the highest rate of homelessness in the state.

Curiously, though flying was then more primitive, it was also more comfortable. In 1934, American Airlines coaxed Douglas Aircraft into coming up with something that would be called a DC-3. This pleasure dome would carry 14 passengers, with one berth each, from New York to Los Angeles. Before then, the trip took 25 hours and required 15 stops. Now you stopped only three times, and were there in 17 hours and 30 minutes. The volume's endpapers invoke the view-from-the-air of the modernist T.W.A. The graphic shows us two routes from west to east. To fly to Europe meant landings at Newfoundland, Ireland and Paris or Newfoundland, the Azores and Lisbon. It is the curse of the jet that except when traveling to the Far East one is never in it long enough to eat, drink, be merry and sleep. The label art reminds us at once of the airlines' utilitarian beginnings (\"Hoosier Airplane Lines. 1923 Charter. 1924 Air Taxi. Serving Fort Wayne, Muncie, Indianapolis, Vincennes and Terre Haute. 'Silver Wings,' Operator\") and of the ends they would go to in trying to make you feel loved. \"American Flagship Skysleeper\" wasn't a bag tag -- that was the legend painted on the hull of the DC-3. When ux and I went off on our wedding trip in 1950, we rented the tail end of the Pan Am DC-4, a mini-suite. Price? $150. . . . The old tags, it transpires, are valuable, so have a look in your attic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"A Mortgage Hurdle Blocks Some Co-ops Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/realestate/a-mortgage-hurdle-blocks-some-co-ops-sales.html","abstract":"  FOR Dianne Landi, home is a bird, a one-bedroom bird with long, slender wings and a large, curved beak.

It's a promising bill that would curb reliance on special interests and foster greater competition by establishing a system of spending limits and partial public financing for House and Senate campaigns.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"BEST SELLERS: June 6, 1993","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/books/best-sellers-june-6-1993.html","abstract":"                        Weeks       This   Last   On       Week   Week   List   Fiction                     1   1   43 THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, by Robert James Waller.

As an A & R (artists and repertory) executive at Columbia, Mr. Dunbar is responsible for recruiting hip, challenging and (it is hoped) potentially profitable young bands to the label. His biggest assets for the job, he says, are his long, stringy hair hanging down almost to his waist and his thick, uncombed beard.

No less important is the fact that the Grand Palais show, which continues through June 14, has not been dictated by some satrap of the seminar.

In his \"Experiment in Autobiography\" (1934), Wells expressed his determination to write \"biographical and autobiographical matter\" that was \"so much more real and interesting and satisfying that I doubt if I shall ever again turn back towards The Novel.\" Wells excoriated \"the race of silly young men who announce that they are going to write The Novel\" and saw that \"perhaps in 1965  [ these ]  foolish young men will all be trailing in the wake of Lytton Strachey and Philip Guedalla and announcing colossal biography-sequences.

It lies on a climatic fault line where westerly winds blowing off the North Sea meet dry winds blowing, reputedly, out of the Russian steppes. People look out their windows into claustrophobic courtyards and then spend their weekends walking through vast, forestlike parks. Architecturally, it is a city of confounding ugliness -- of once pompous prewar buildings with their now charred, or missing, or jarringly restored facades; of banal, poured-concrete apartments and office blocks on both sides of the former wall; of contemporary architectural experiments that can look like recent wounds surrounded by so many scars. It is also a city of exquisite, if infrequent, beauty. Karl Friedrich Schinkel's cool classicism, for instance. And the inspired, often utopian innovations of the 1920's -- many influenced by Schinkel -- are often, even in their postwar, reconstructed versions, still exciting and surprising. Schinkel's buildings, many of which are in the center of the city, are almost unavoidable, but the best examples of Weimar-era architecture are -- to my mind -- the great housing developments known as public-housing estates, or Gross-Siedlung. They are all in the outer districts of town, but easily reached by subway.    The first to be constructed -- and, at the time, the most famous -- was the \"horseshoe,\" or Hufeisen, estate, one section of the Gross-Siedlung Britz, in the working-class borough of Neukolln, southeast of the city center. The Horseshoe Estate, built between 1925 and 1927, is so called because the focal point of its thousand or so dwellings is a horseshoe-shaped three-story apartment building. Three streets of one-family houses surround the horseshoe, and the boundaries of the estate are bordered, for the most part, by three-story apartment houses. Bruno Taut, Weimar Berlin's most productive architect, designed much of the project, including the horseshoe itself, but credit is also given to Martin Wagner, who designed the apartments on the estate's northern boundary. Wagner, as a member of the building society that financed the construction and, later, as Berlin's chief city planner, was the driving force behind the city's 1920's housing revolution.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Sports of The Times; Racing Can't Afford More Tragedies","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/sports/sports-of-the-times-racing-can-t-afford-more-tragedies.html","abstract":"  HOW much more of this can racing take?

Jim Florio in November, may hinge on the support the candidates attract from voters like those in Mr. Perot's state organization, United We Stand America of New Jersey, and from the nearly two million undeclared voters who outnumber registered Democrats, Republicans and independents together.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Casinos Fear Competition in Backyard","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/nyregion/casinos-fear-competition-in-backyard.html","abstract":"  WITH a mixture of pride and trepidation, the leaders of the casino industry in Atlantic City last weekend marked the 15th anniversary of the date when New Jersey made casino gambling legal.

The reduction of fresh air is done only on newer planes. Older aircraft built before the mid-1980's provided cabins with 100 percent fresh air that was circulated every three minutes. But the newer models provide half fresh air and half recirculated air that is freshened every six or seven minutes or longer. The recirculation system enables the planes to use less fuel to cool the outside air, which is heated by the engines as it is drawn in.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Tap Water in Bottles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/opinion/l-tap-water-in-bottles-774893.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   A May 20 article finds the word \"tacky\" indispensable and proceeds to give and grade numerous examples of tackiness.

Always at the top of the dispute list is \"obscene art.\" The work funded by the endowment that has stirred an outcry constitutes less than 1 percent of the agency's $175 million budget. Robert Mapplethorpe, for example, spent much of his artistic energy on innovative photographs of flowers -- the black and white depictions of homoeroticism constituted a small, but nonetheless vital, part of his lifetime body of work. The imposition of standards of decency can only turn funded works into formulaic colors on canvas, a contradiction of what artistic expression really is.   What should be kept in mind, though, is that a good deal of arts endowment dollars bring exhibitions and performance to rural areas of the United States where residents would not otherwise be exposed to or engaged in the artistic discourse of America today. The endowment also aids in the genesis and production of ballet and operatic performance in cities, long suffering from both Federal and state cutbacks in funds.   The first job of the new head should be to enlighten citizens about the functions and benefits of the National Endowment for the Arts, and to dispel the misconceptions introduced during the last 12 years. Only then can the agency engage the public in the multifaceted and forever evolving conversation we know as American art. ELISE H.

Doubtless, most Americans, asked \"Do you want your taxes raised?\", will answer no. But ask: \"Do you want cuts in Social Security, Medicare and other entitlements? To have no money for police, for fixing roads, education and research? To have the United States sink to mediocrity, with the good life for only the wealthy?\" The answer would also be no.   By all indications, it isn't possible to pay no more in taxes, or to reduce nonmilitary public expenditure, and still have a country with first-rate social institutions. The last 12 years of conservative claims that these things can coexist by cutting the fat out of our Government have been refuted by a quadrupling of the national debt in that period. After 12 years of trying, conservative fat cutters found little waste, but put a lot of worthwhile activities in a state of chronic malnourishment, which will cost us a lot more than what we save by starving our institutions. The cost of the savings and loan bailout is the most spectacular result.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19930606","headline":"Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat wins the first presidential election in Mongolia.","pages":[{"title":"Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punsalmaagiin_Ochirbat","description":"1st President of Mongolia (1990–97)","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Ochirbat-Punsalmaa.jpg","thumbnail_width":187,"thumbnail_height":241},"abstract":"Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat is a Mongolian political figure and a current member of the Constitutional Court of Mongolia.

Niemeier also made Kansas' final out. Fontana stranded five runners to keep Long Beach State (44-18) alive in the double-elimination tournament.

L.S.U. (51-16-1), which trailed by 7-2 in the fifth, had gotten within 8-7 heading into the eighth. Singles by Mike Neal, Jim Greely and Adrian Antonini loaded the bases.
