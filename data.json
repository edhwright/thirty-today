Jim Florio did the right thing, and that is why his time is up. Christine Todd Whitman succeeds him as New Jersey's chief executive on Tuesday, in large part because of the huge hike in taxes enacted in his first 100 days. It was a necessary move, but many voters regarded it as a betrayal. It set off a tax revolt that propelled the Republicans in 1992 to control of the Legislature, and now Mrs. Whitman to the governor's mansion.   If Jim Florio failed on that count, he succeeded on gun control. In the same burst of activity that saw reluctant Democratic legislators approve his tax bill, he put through a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. New Jersey was first to do so; Governor Florio dared take on the powerful lobbyists of the National Rifle Association. Indeed, he beat them twice, on the original legislation in 1991 and again last year when he stood down the now-Republican Legislature's attempt at repeal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940115","headline":"49ers Edgy and Tense, With Good Reason","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/15/sports/on-pro-football-49ers-edgy-and-tense-with-good-reason.html","abstract":"  The San Francisco 49ers are edgy.

In the final scene of that dandy mini-series, the politically powerful Tory whip tossed his young mistress, a journalist about to expose his nasty deeds, from a tower of the Palace of Westminster.    Now, in the somewhat less-than-dandy \"To Play the King,\" the four-part \"Cards\" sequel beginning tomorrow on \"Masterpiece Theater,\" Francis finds his vastly increased power being threatened by bigger game: the King himself. The Queen has been succeeded by her son (Michael Kitchen), who just happens to have an estranged blond wife (Erika Hoffman) and a fat, indiscreet sister-in-law (Bernice Stegers). British television makes a habit of bringing a special verve to this sort of political thriller.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940115","headline":"Transactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/15/sports/transactions-882216.html","abstract":"  Football  National Football League INDIANAPOLIS COLTS -- Fired Jack Bushofsky, director of player personnel.

According to Gary Hufbauer and Kimberly Elliott of the Institute for International Economics, it will save the typical American family $500 a year.

The trade agreement, when instituted, will cut that cost in half by opening up markets to low-cost imports.

The words were neither a \"challenge\" to Mr. Bawer's relationship nor a \"telling slip\" showing subconscious disrespect. Nor were they a statement that our ability to procreate makes my husband and me qualitatively different from those involved in single-sex relationships. The words were a statement of the ardent love that my husband and I share, and a celebration of every other relationship founded on passion, friendship and honor. BONNIE G. KLEIN  Falls Church, Va. Margaret O'Brien Steinfels replies:   The letters address my proposition that \"society has a legitimate interest in privileging those heterosexual unions that are oriented toward the generation and rearing of children,\" but do not directly attack it. Instead, they emphasize the ways in which legal marriage departs from this role, embracing not only the infertile and adoptive, but increasingly the intentionally childless. If we've gone this far, the letter writers ask, why stop here? Why exclude gay people?   I agree that American society seems to be moving from an understanding of marriage largely in terms of family and intergenerational ties to one that emphasizes intimacy and the fulfillment of two individuals. Appealing to this movement as a precedent is not convincing to those who believe that it has already gone too far. None of the letters mention the most dramatic example of the way in which family life has changed -- namely, the rapid rise in out-of-wedlock births and children living in single-parent or no-parent households. There are people who argue that to avoid stigmatization, we should regard these nontraditional forms as normal. But this social experiment of only some 25 years' duration is failing large numbers of children and women. This underlines the enormous social benefit that comes when two people vow not only to care for each other but to sustain the kind of relationship commonly involving several decades of caring for the next generation. That is why I suspect society will want marriages recognized as qualitatively different from other relationships.   I suggested that this widespread concern remains high on the agenda for the dialogue that I believed Mr. Bawer was advancing. His letter implies that dialogue is conditional on prior agreement. He believes that warning of the psychological consequences to gay people and their families of rejection resolves the \"family\" issue. But nowhere does he address the social and political concerns I raise. It is here that his metaphor, \"a place at the table,\" misleads. No nation is one big happy family, least of all our own. Our genius has been to transcend family limitations to create a public space where all of us may interact, if only to agree to disagree. The entrance ticket is tolerance, not approval.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940116","headline":"'Most Expensive' School District","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/16/nyregion/l-most-expensive-school-district-862088.html","abstract":"  \"Most Expensive District,\" the Dec. 12 article about the Union County Regional High School District, has some omissions and misstatements.

It is an edge that already cuts through competitors in hot pursuit of a yard, a foot, an inch that pulls one closer to victory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940116","headline":"Streetscapes/Bronx Botanical Conservatory; When Is a Restoration Not a Restoration?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/16/realestate/streetscapes-bronx-botanical-conservatory-when-restoration-not-restoration.html","abstract":"  HOW long is a full-scale restoration good for?

With the click of a button or the flip of a page, we can compress a city into a dot, a neighborhood into a caption, a building into a slide. Ever more efficient media techniques help us to filter out life's cumbersome dimensions. The nightly news can flatten California faster than an earthquake.   But architecture deals with space, with people, and with the lives they drag in through the door. And a walk through a building, particularly one that lies off your usual path, can be a powerful way to rid yourself of flatland's deadening filters. For instance, if you can arrange to visit one of the three new New York City elementary schools designed by Peter Samton and Jorge Luaces of the firm Gruzen Samton, your view of the inner city will be unimaginably enlarged. When you hear the words \"New York City public school,\" you will not automatically think \"asbestos.\" You will not withdraw into nostalgic reveries of a time when the city was a beacon of opportunity. Instead, you will see a democratic hothouse where New York's egalitarian tradition is sending forth young shoots.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940116","headline":"C. L.

To help speed the passage, most train or bus riders read newspapers or novels, listen to music or stare out the windows, daydreaming and letting the New Jersey swamps soothe their souls. A few flip open laptop computers to stretch the workday.\n\nBut some commuters express more of their personalities and alter egos while they ride. For Kathy Pichieri, that means a complete break from her job, where she is responsible for weighty administrative matters like 401(k) plans. For the hour and 10 minutes that she spends on the train from Dover to her office in Jersey City, she enters the world of cotton string, a metal hook and photocopied instructions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940116","headline":"POSTINGS: Lincoln Towers Co-op;","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/16/realestate/postings-lincoln-towers-co-op.html","abstract":"  In the world of co-op refinancings, a $10 million deal is significant.

But the real questions underlying WHO STOLE THE NEWS? Why We Can't Keep Up With What Happens in the World and What We Can Do About It (Wiley, $24.95) are a bit more mundane: what is news, and why doesn't anyone seem to care much about anything beyond the immediately domestic? Americans are infamous around the world for being uninterested in things foreign -- a foolish attitude on a planet whose nations are more and more interlinked, Mr. Rosenblum argues. Television and the profit motive are the primary culprits keeping the population mired in ignorance, he contends. News organizations forgo foreign news because there is scant consumer interest. No surprises there. Yet given the low priority assigned most foreign events by news media executives, it is still possible for citizens to obtain the information necessary to make informed judgments. Readers must simply hunt it down in newspapers, magazines and journals. Much, of course, depends on the quality of reporting itself, and here is where Mr. Rosenblum is most interesting. He laces his argument with numerous examples of the trials, woes and infelicities endemic to reporting abroad. His devastating portrait of American military censorship during the Persian Gulf war and of the timidity and smugness of the press during that conflict is particularly noteworthy. The fact is that no one stole the news. The news is there; it just has to be claimed, a point Mr. Rosenblum makes rather well. \nSTEPHAN SALISBURY","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940116","headline":"Giuliani Backer Reports Possible Threats","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/16/nyregion/giuliani-backer-reports-possible-threats.html","abstract":"  Two bullet holes and a handwritten note were found Friday morning at a housing project in Harlem that is named after a supporter of Mayor Rudolph W.

It is not that there is no substance behind the American approach to Russia today. There is. And it is not that there is no money behind it, either. It is that no more money will be delivered, or make a substantive difference, unless President Boris N.

It was 1935 and Angel, down on his luck, promptly ferried his mysterious passenger to one of 100 table mountains that rise abruptly from Venezuela's forest floor. After a bumpy landing in his Flamingo monoplane, pilot and passenger set up camp by a stream on the mesa. In three days, they panned 75 pounds of gold.   Returning to Caracas, Mr. Angel lost contact with his passenger, an elderly engineer. Trying to return, but without his treasure guide, the American pilot fruitlessly scoured the 200,000-square-mile wilderness for the golden stream. One day he crash landed in a bog on top of an 8,000-foot high mesa, Auyan Tepui. Two weeks later the exhausted adventurer emerged on foot, bearing with him knowledge of a secret the local Pemon Indians had guarded for centuries: Churun-Meru, the highest waterfall in the world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940116","headline":"Heartbreak City","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/16/books/heartbreak-city.html","abstract":"  LIFE & LOVE, SUCH AS THEY ARE By Anna Shapiro. 240 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $21.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940116","headline":"The Grand Acquisitor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/16/books/the-grand-acquisitor.html","abstract":"SKADDEN\nPower, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire.\nBy Lincoln Caplan.\nIllustrated. 341 pp. New York: \nFarrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940116","headline":"Photographers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/16/travel/l-photographers-839914.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: As serious amateur photographers who have done quite a bit of traveling we feel compelled to respond to the letter from Elizabeth M.

By midweek, when new snow covered the ice, those heavy combat boots with tread on the soles finally proved their worth. Leggings and short coats were perfect for jumping over flooded crosswalks; the fashionable long coats and skirts were no match for the ankle-deep slush and had to be hiked up.

This was particularly true in the United States, where the antiwar, free speech and civil rights movements had inspired artists and graphic designers to create reams of visual agitation -- some of which became icons of the era. Memorable graphics were noticeably absent during the 1970's. Yet by the 80's, concurrent with Ronald Reagan's Administration, social and political activism was again on the rise throughout the world, and so were political graphics. Liz McQuiston, a graphic design critic and historian in London, surveys the wide range of graphic arts produced internationally during the past three decades in GRAPHIC AGITATION: Social and Political Graphics Since the Sixties (Phaidon/Chronicle, $49.95). The book is the first comprehensive overview of these posters, billboards, flyers, periodicals, buttons and T-shirts. Ms. McQuiston writes that during the 70's the environment and human rights were significant issues, and not until the 80's did social movements and individuals refocus their attention on community issues and redirect their efforts toward producing visual propaganda. Sexual orientation and AIDS became focal points for artists, many of whom belonged to poster brigades and graphics collectives and engaged in guerrilla activities that included billboard defacement and illegal bill posting. Ms. McQuiston offers an extensive collection of both familiar and rare materials gathered from scores of grass-roots and urban advocacy groups. The effectiveness of recent productless, issue-oriented advertisements for mainstream businesses (such as those for Benetton) is also scrutinized. This ambitious chronicle is a must for the scholars, students and practitioners of alternative media.

Is the angst of Expressionism ready to return, sweeping away Minimalist cool in its Eastern and Western guises?

On college campuses 25 years ago, Schoenberg was the hero of 20th-century music, and \"Erwartung\" was considered his masterpiece. Here was a work that threw out all the machinery of 19th-century music: no tonality, no themes, no tunes, no repetition and, perhaps most important, no pandering to the public. \"Today the only works which really count are those which are no longer works at all,\" wrote the philosopher Theodor Adorno in 1948. \"Erwartung\" summed up every radical tendency of the century, including contempt for the very category of masterpiece.

Corey Gaines, whom the Knicks signed as a free agent last month, also provided a spark off the bench during six fourth-quarter minutes though he had only 2 points. - As a result, the Knicks (24-9) won their fourth consecutive game, while the Pistons (8-25) have lost 12 consecutive games.

By today's supposedly rational standards, it may be grandiose, inefficient, even wasteful; yet it is also comfortably solid, an endearing relic of an era that through the distorting lens of time seems simpler and more emotionally direct.   By the time Korngold composed the suite, in 1930, Schoenberg and his school had already wrung what they considered useful out of the densely chromatic late Romantic style, and were hoping to discover a new world beyond tonality. Korngold, like Richard Strauss, demurred, believing that there was life in tonality yet. Here he used traditional forms -- a prelude and fugue, a lilting Viennese waltz and a set of variations -- as well as freer structures. But the forms did not constrain his imagination: color, sentimentality and even a kind of cinematic drama pour out of the piece.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940117","headline":"Julie C.

He finished ahead of Thomas Sykora, and completed a successful weekend for the Austrian team before the home fans, following Patrick Ortlieb's victory in Saturday's downhill. (AP) Wachter Wins Again: Anita Wachter of Austria scored her third World Cup victory of the season, beating Deborah Compagnoni, a hometown hero, in a giant slalom in Cortina D'Ampezzo, Italy. Wachter, the World Cup champion, dominated a highly technical race by clocking the fastest time in both runs down the Olimpia Tofane course. Her total time was 2 minutes 38.80 seconds as Compagnoni finished .73 seconds behind. (AP)   TRACK AND FIELD  Ford Games Showcase  Lyria Martin, a La Guardia High School sophomore, and William Arnold, a Bishop Ford junior, turned in impressive performances yesterday in the Bishop Ford games at the West 168th Street Armory. More than 1,500 boys and girls from 73 Eastern high schools took part in the meet. Martin, the Eastern states outdoor 100-meter champion, won the girls 55-meter dash in 7 seconds flat. Martin's time was 40.5 seconds. Arnold, winner of the mile at Brown University last month in 4 minutes 22.9 seconds, waited until the final turn to pass the leader, Jim Colling, the Virginia state mile champion from Chantilly, to win in 4:25.0. Colling, running his first indoor race this season, was second in 4:26.2. Bruce Rosado, another Ford runner who won the 800 meters at Brown in 1:59.3, kicked down the final straightaway to win the 1,000-meter run in 2:34.8.  HORSE RACING  Diazo a Disappointment  Zignew, a 21-1 long shot, took the lead inside the eighth pole and scored a 1 3/4-length victory yesterday in the $225,500 San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita in Acadia, Calif. Zignew held off the stretch drives of Nonproductiveasset and Pacific Tango for her fifth victory in 12 starts. The winner covered a mile and an eighth in 1:47 4/5 and paid $44.80, $20.60 and $11.60 for $2 across the board. Diazo, the 17-10 favorite with stablemate Stuka, was kept in good position behind pace-setter Bat Eclat during the first mile of the Grade II event for 4-year-olds. That's when Zignew passed Del Mar Dennis and Diazo at the top of the stretch and went on to win the second leg of the Strub Series. Diazo, trained by Bill Shoemaker and ridden by Laffit Pincay, captured the first leg when he won the Malibu Stakes on Dec. 26. He was ninth in the 12-horse field yesterday.

The silent-film star's dreamy, languid gaze appears on screens mounted in a set resembling the lobby of a 1920's movie theater. A voice, ostensibly from an early Victrola, begins to sing in the style of Rudy Vallee, mourning the passing of the screen idol. The pop lyrics are first overlaid with the sound of a male chorus intoning the Latin Requiem, then with the vocalizing of a soprano, and finally, with loving declarations by a woman in black. There are five singing lines going at once in clashing keys and styles.   It is a daring way to open an opera, even for someone as lyrically gifted as Mr. Argento. And for all the awkwardness of the first night's performance of this opening gambit, it was clear that it was meant to suggest momentous grandeur, religious pomp, pop sentimentality and personal devotion, all combined into a contradictory whole. There is somebody of great importance lying in state (or so the music proclaims), whose impact was profound. \"The Dream of Valentino,\" which will be performed until Feb. 13, promises to explain how and why.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940117","headline":"Giuliani Delivers Strong Plea, Seeking to Ease Blacks' Fears","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/17/nyregion/giuliani-delivers-strong-plea-seeking-to-ease-blacks-fears.html","abstract":"  Mayor Rudolph W.

Even while he has branched out to become a director of opera and plays by others, his contribution remains instantly identifiable. Whatever he does, he leaves sight and sound tracks as his signature, and his art has always had a deeply intellectual foundation.   In rehearsal at St. Mark's Theater with his new play, \"My Head Was a Sledgehammer,\" Mr. Foreman is at the electronic controls, interjecting suggestions to his actors and orchestrating the mechanics of the enterprise. With a mournful mien that extends from his eyes to his mustache, he is a younger, avant-garde doppelganger of Broadway's David Merrick. As the author fine-tunes the performance, a spiderlike chandelier revolves like a fan in a Singapore hotel; string -- a Foreman trademark -- crisscrosses and stratifies the stage, and Oriental carpets cushion the walls.
