Ensemble, the legendary experimental musician and composer David Tudor gave a solo performance last Saturday night at Willow Place Auditorium in Brooklyn Heights. While Mr. Tudor is still best known for his astounding performances of avant-garde piano and conceptual music in the 1950's and 60's, particularly his collaborations with John Cage, in recent years he has largely given up the piano and devoted himself to electronic composition. His major contribution as a composer has been an ever-evolving technique of electronic-music performance.   On Saturday night, Mr. Tudor introduced a new electronic system designed especially for him: the Neural Network Audio Synthesizer, a fearsomely complex apparatus that processes analog signals through something called a \"neural network chip.\" The composer had available a variety of pre-taped segments, which he modified by the flicking of cryptic switches. As the second half-hour segment went on, it became apparent that all was not well; Mr. Tudor looked frustrated, and made fewer interventions toward the end. Afterward he said: \"I'd better stop; all of my inputs are down, and I don't have the slightest idea where the sounds are coming from.\" The machine had taken over from the composer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930313","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/13/nyregion/c-corrections-592093.html","abstract":"  The Our Towns column yesterday, about rubbernecking, referred incorrectly to Fred Feldman, a former traffic reporter.

The attacks on Israelis have provoked retaliatory assaults on Arabs by Jewish settlers in the territories and aggressive responses by Israeli motorists and soldiers to Arab stone-throwing. Concerned that the violence is spinning out of control, army officers warned settlers against further vigilante action against Palestinians, and the police announced that they would increase roadblocks and spot-checks of Arabs in Israel.

Now Mr. Mitchell, one of the few black dancers to reach stardom in American ballet, is returning to the State Theater as the director of an internationally celebrated troupe, renowned for the freshness, integrity and exuberance of its classical dancing -- and for the fact that most of its 49 dancers are black.

I understand that European Gypsies meet in the Camargue in May for two days. Can you supply details? -- Angelo J. Brenna, New York N.Y.     A.  The Gypsy Pilgrimage takes place each May 24 and 25 at Stes.-Maries-de-la-Mer, about 14 miles south of Arles. Provencal legend says the place, in the marshlands of the Camargue, was where St. Marie Jacobe and St. Marie Salome and their servant, St. Sarah, among others, arrived safely on shore after being abandoned in a boat off Palestine. The three saints remained in the Camargue and were buried there. A church was built at their tomb in the ninth century, and the building was replaced in the 12th century. Gypsies (who call themselves Romany) consider Sarah their patron saint, and thousands of them, many of whom still live in caravans in their traditional nomadic life, arrive at the town each year. The pilgrimage events begin May 24 with a mass at 10 A.M. at the church. At 3 P.M. is the descente des chasses, in which the bones of the three saints are lowered by rope and pulley from an upper chapel to an altar in the chancel. At 4 P.M. there is the St. Sarah procession, in which a painted wood figure of the saint is taken to the sea for blessing.

Some of Mr. Eagle's images that probably appeared fresh and poetic at the time -- particularly his many shots of withered old Jewish men in prayer -- have now become cliched. More interesting are his photographs of men gathered in Union Square to argue about world events, of the dining room of a hall for the elderly, and of several clean-cut boys learning the prayers and traditions of the synagogue. Mr. Eagle's photographs do not carry the weight of such ominous images as those taken by Roman Vishniac of impoverished Eastern European Jews shortly before the Holocaust.

Detective Rudolph Zitti and his partner, Officer Raymond Ruiz, received a tip on Friday that the suspect, Jose Batista, 23, had just arrived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, said Sergeant Tina Mohrmann, a spokeswoman for the New York City Police Department. Grabbed Detective's Pistol    Eight plainclothes officers began a stakeout in the neighborhood, the police said. Mr. Batista was spotted at 10:54 P.M. Friday as he walked near 2875 Sedgwick Avenue, just south of Reservoir Avenue, the sergeant said. When the officers approached him, he ran and they gave chase, she said.   During the pursuit, Mr. Batista picked up a stick and swung at the officers, the police said. The officers cornered him and tried to subdue him, but he grabbed Detective Zitti's service pistol and fired one shot, grazing the detective on the hand, Sergeant Mohrmann said. Officer Ruiz then fired one shot, striking Mr. Batista in the head, she said. Mr. Batista, whose address is unknown, died at the scene, the police said.   Detective Zitti was treated at Montefiore Medical Center for the graze wound and released. Officer Ruiz was treated at the hospital for trauma and released. Investigation Continuing    Sergeant Mohrmann said a preliminary investigation had concluded that the shooting was justified. She said the investigation is continuing.   Mr. Batista is suspected of being involved in a burglary of a house at 442 Fifth Street in Elmont, L.I., on Dec. 21, 1991, said Detective Frederic Eno, a Nassau County Police spokesman.   Officer Christopher Pohren was one of several officers who responded to a burglary alarm and caught four armed men leaving the house, Detective Eno said.

Robert Silverberg's KINGDOMS OF THE WALL (Spectra/Bantam, $22.95) is a parable about the danger of seeking more intimate contact with the powers that control the universe. On a distant planet a race of people who superficially resemble humans lives at the foot of a mountain so steep and so tall that it is known as the Wall. Their myths tell of a Prometheus-like First Climber who ascended the Wall and brought back useful knowledge from the gods who live at the summit. In honor of this First Climber, the people periodically choose 40 of their best and brightest as Pilgrims, who try to climb the Wall and parley with the gods. Most fail to return; those who do are invariably mad, and their reports of what they have seen at the summit make little sense.   The band of Pilgrims to whom Mr. Silverberg directs our attention has better luck. The Wall turns out to be an entire range of mountains offering trial after trial as horrific as any observered by Dante in the Inferno. Many former Pilgrims have ended up in the clutches of monsters capable of stealing one's body, mind and will. The author makes some attempt to distinguish between these monsters, and there are hints that each Pilgrim's fate is determined by his or her character. But since the only Pilgrims we get to know well are those who escape the monsters, the fate of the less fortunate seems more arbitrary than ordained. Higher up the Wall, the obstacles become more subtle; some regions are so pleasant that the Pilgrims are tempted to settle down and forget their mission. What awaits those who persevere is a revelation that calls into question everything they believe (although it will hardly come as a surprise to the seasoned reader of science fiction).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930314","headline":"THE BLIZZARD OF '93: The Past; '93 Storm Seeks Its Place in History","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/nyregion/the-blizzard-of-93-the-past-93-storm-seeks-its-place-in-history.html","abstract":"  Big as it may be, the Blizzard of '93, is, by far, not \"the mother of all storms,\" as some prognosticators had hyped it.

Ever since hard-core punk obliterated articulation and a mumbling Michael Stipe of R.E.M. triumphed with mood over meaning a decade ago, it has been gauche to demand that a song yield more than an evocative phrase or two.

The Central Station has been restored to its turn-of-the-century Belle Epoque glory. Antwerp's year as Cultural Capital of Europe has begun, and its planners have wisely invested in restoration projects that are close to the heart of the populace.   Antwerp lies on a bend of the River Scheldt, about 50 miles from the sea.  Emperor Charles V made Antwerp Europe's principal port, and the old city around the cathedral and Grote Markt (Main Square) is well preserved, containing splendid Baroque mansions, guild halls and churches. This is mainly a pedestrian area, and gets very lively at night.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930314","headline":"Serbian President Is to Press Commander on Talks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/world/serbian-president-is-to-press-commander-on-talks.html","abstract":"  In a test of his influence over Bosnian Serbs, the President of Serbia said he would try to insure that their top military commander attended the new round of peace talks, scheduled to begin here on Tuesday, diplomats said today.

The alert came as South Korea's military exercises with the United States continued well south of the heavily armed demilitarized zone. North Korea has called the exercises a rehearsal for staging an invasion, and cited them a reason that it became the first nation ever to renounce the treaty. The United States says the annual exercises, which began in 1976, are purely defensive. - Leaders of the South Korean Government of President Kim Young Sam, who took office two weeks ago, spent most of the day in meetings deciding how to respond to North Korea's surprise action. But so far Seoul has said little, other than to say that the action \"heightens the suspicion\" that North Korea is developing nuclear arms. Along with the United States and Japan, South Korea has called on North Korea to retract its decision before it becomes effective in 90 days.   \"There are a lot of discussions about what to do next, but the border is very quiet,\" Ryu Myung Hwan, the spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said this afternoon.   Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on Friday that he believed North Korea's withdrawal from the treaty and its refusal to allow inspection of two suspected nuclear sites would likely be taken up by the United Nations Security Council unless the hard-line Communist Government of President Kim Il Sung reversed its course.

But for budget-conscious travelers there is an alternative: You can rent an apartment, as we did on three separate occasions last summer, fall and winter, and live like Russians -- for about $15 a night. The advantages go beyond savings: You can experience some of the Russian hospitality that guidebooks celebrate but visitors seldom feel on guided tours or in luxury hotels. Our landlords have invited us for meals in their homes and suffocated us with kindness, as if we were distant relatives from a planet called Amerika. You have a place to entertain Russian friends or business associates, many of whom may find it difficult to get past the tight security at hotels catering to foreigners. Even the most sophisticated Russians, moreover, could feel self-conscious sitting around a dinner table in an upscale restaurant while their countrymen suffer food shortages. Lastly, in a land where greasy borscht, fried meat and potatoes are often the norm, you can cook and drink as you please in your own apartment. For early risers, this means not having to wait until 8 A.M., when most hotel restaurants open, for that first cup of coffee.\n\nSkeptical gourmets can breathe easy, too. Every good-sized city now has dollar-only grocery stores. Most are no larger than a 7-Eleven and are stocked with German milk, Finnish yogurt, British cornflakes and French wine, as well as such sundries as Dutch disposable diapers.

In the 1960's the columns were collected and went through two editions. Some of them have now been translated by William Weaver and will be published in paperback in May by Harcourt Brace & Company as a Helen and Kurt Wolff Book under the title \"Misreadings.\" The excerpts below are taken from a piece titled \"Regretfully, We Are Returning Your . . .\" -- reports from professional readers of manuscripts submitted to publishers by agents or hopeful authors.\n\n\"The Bible.\" Anonymous.\n\nI must say that the first few hundred pages of this manuscript really hooked me. Action-packed, they have everything today's reader wants in a good story. Sex (lots of it, including adultery, sodomy, incest), also murder, war, massacres and so on.\n\nThe Sodom and Gomorrah chapter, with the transvestites putting the make on the angels, is worthy of Rabelais; the Noah stories are pure Jules Verne; the escape from Egypt cries out to be turned into a major motion picture. In other words, a real blockbuster, very well structured, with plenty of twists, full of invention, with just the right amount of piety, and never lapsing into tragedy.\n\nBut as I kept on reading, I realized that this is actually an anthology, involving several writers, with many -- too many -- stretches of poetry, and passages that are downright mawkish and boring, and jeremiads that make no sense.\n\nThe end result is a monster omnibus. It seems to have something for everybody, but ends up appealing to nobody. And acquiring the rights from all these different authors will mean big headaches, unless the editor takes care of that himself. The editor's name, by the way, doesn't appear anywhere on the manuscript, not even in the table of contents. Is there some reason for keeping his identity a secret?\n\nI'd suggest trying to get the rights only to the first five chapters. We're on sure ground there. Also come up with a better title. How about \"The Red Sea Desperadoes?\"\n\"The Odyssey.\" Homer. \n\nPersonally, I like this book. A good yarn, exciting, packed with adventure. Sufficient love interest, both marital fidelity and adulterous flings (Calypso is a great character, a real man-eater); there's even a Lolita aspect, with the teen-ager Nausicaa, where the author doesn't spell things out, but it's a turn-on anyway. Great dramatic moments, a one-eyed giant, cannibals, even some drugs, but nothing illegal, because as far as I know the lotus isn't on the Narcotics Bureau's list. The final scene is in the best tradition of the Western: some heavy fist-swinging, and the business with the bow is a masterstroke of suspense.\n\nWhat can I say? It's a page turner, all right, not like the author's first book, which was too static, all concerned with unity of place and tediously overplotted. By the time the reader reached the third battle and the 10th duel, he already got the idea. But this second book is a totally different thing: it reads as smooth as silk. The tone is calmer, pondered but not ponderous. And then the montage, the use of flashbacks, the stories within stories. . . . In a word, this Homer is the right stuff. He's smart.\n\nToo smart, maybe. I wonder if it's all really his own work. I know, of course, a writer can improve with experience (his third book will probably be a sensation), but what makes me uncomfortable -- and, finally, leads me to cast a negative vote -- is the mess the question of rights will cause. In the first place, the author's nowhere to be found. People who knew him say it was always hard to discuss any changes to be made in the text, because he was as blind as a bat, couldn't follow the manuscript, and even gave the impression he wasn't completely familiar with it. Did he really write the book or did he just sign it?\n\"The Divine Comedy.\" Alighieri, Dante.\n\nAlighieri is your typical Sunday writer. (In everyday life he's an active member of the pharmacists' guild.) Still, his work shows an undeniable grasp of technique and considerable narrative flair. The book, in the Florentine dialect, consists of about a hundred rhymed chapters, and much of it is interesting and readable. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of astronomy and certain concise, provocative theological notions. The third part of the book is the best and will have the widest appeal; it involves subjects of general interest, concerns of the common reader -- salvation, the Beatific Vision, prayers to the Virgin. But the first part is obscure and self-indulgent, with passages of cheap eroticism, violence and downright crudity. But the greatest drawback is the author's choice of his local dialect (inspired no doubt by some crackpot avant-garde idea). We all know that today's Latin needs a shot in the arm -- it isn't just the little literary cliques that insist on this. But there's a limit, after all, if not in the rules of language then at least to the public's ability to understand.\n\"Justine.\" Sade, D. A. Francois.\n\nThe manuscript was in a whole pile of things I had to look at this week and, to be honest, I haven't read it through. I opened it at random three times, in three different places, which, as you know, is enough for a trained eye.\n\nWell, the first time I found an avalanche of words, page after page, about the philosophy of nature, with digressions on the cruelty of the struggle for survival, the reproduction of plants, and the cycles of animal species. The second time: at least 15 pages on the concept of pleasure, the senses and the imagination, and so on. The third time: 20 pages on the question of submission between men and women in various countries of the world. I think that's enough. We're not looking for a work of philosophy. Today's audience wants sex, sex, and more sex. In every shape and form.\n\"A la Recherche du Temps Perdu.\" Proust, Marcel.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a serious work, perhaps too long, but as a paperback series it could sell.\n\nBut it won't do as is. It needs serious editing. For example, the punctuation has to be redone. The sentences are too labored; some take up a whole page. With plenty of good in-house work, reducing each sentence to a maximum of two or three lines, breaking up paragraphs, indenting more often, the book would be enormously improved.\n\nIf the author doesn't agree, then forget it. As it stands, the book is too -- what's the word? -- asthmatic.\n\"Critique of Practical Reason.\" Kant, Immanuel.\n\nI asked Susan to take a look at this, and she tells me that after Barthes there's no point translating this Kant. In any case, I glanced at it myself. A reasonably short book on morality could fit nicely into our philosophy series, and might even be adopted by some universities. But the German publisher says that if we take this one, we have to commit ourselves not only to the author's previous book, which is an immense thing in at least two volumes, but also to the one he is working on now, about art or about judgment, I'm not sure which. All three books have more or less the same title, so they would have to be sold boxed (and at a price no reader could afford); otherwise bookshop browsers would mistake one for the other and think, \"I've already read this.\"\n\nThere's another problem. The German agent tells me that we would also have to publish the minor works of this Kant, a whole pile of stuff including something about astronomy. I would advise against getting involved with a man like this; we'll end up with a mountain of his books in the warehouse.\n\"The Trial.\" Kafka, Franz.\n\nNice little book. A thriller with some Hitchcock touches. The final murder, for example. It could have an audience.\n\nBut apparently the author wrote under a regime with heavy censorship. Otherwise, why all these vague references, this trick of not giving names to people or places? And why is the protagonist being put on trial? If we clarify these points and make the setting more concrete (facts are needed: facts, facts, facts), then the action will be easier to follow and suspense is assured. Genuine writing has to keep in mind the old newspaperman's five questions: Who? What? When? Where? Why? If we can have a free hand with editing, I'd say buy it. If not, not.\n\"Finnegans Wake.\" Joyce, James.\n\nPlease, tell the office manager to be more careful when he sends books out to be read. I'm the English-language reader, and you've sent me a book written in some other, Godforsaken language. I'm returning it under separate cover.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930314","headline":"Sports of The Times; New Ice Age Has Struck The Big East","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/sports/sports-of-the-times-new-ice-age-has-struck-the-big-east.html","abstract":"  AGIANT depression looms over the Big East tournament, packing high winds and slippery underfooting, making for hazardous travel conditions.

The first half of \"Off the Wall to Wall,\" from noon to 6 P.M., featured many scored works, whose formal structure worked well within the time allotted.  Standouts included Norman Yamada's delicate \"In Celebration of Year One\"; David Shea's \"The Prisoner,\" which invoked 1960's television soundtracks and post-modern hip-hop within an avant-garde milieu, and a brief piece by Eric Qin, performed on synthesized tape-loop percussion by Christine Bard and James Pugliese, that showed how the rhythm of utterance can alter the meaning of words.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930315","headline":"In The Post's Newsroom, Some Efforts to Publish","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/15/nyregion/in-the-post-s-newsroom-some-efforts-to-publish.html","abstract":"  A bottle of antacid tablets within his reach, Marc Kalech, the managing editor of The New York Post, shifted uncomfortably in front of his desk yesterday before giving a grim assessment of the newspaper's future: \"My inclination is we will not publish a paper.\"   Two hours later -- amid the threat of layoffs, shrill protests throughout the newsroom and the sudden resignation of the latest editor -- some reporters and editors agreed by 5:30 P.M. to put out the next day's paper.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930315","headline":"Review/Music; Solutions to a Partnership Problem","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/15/arts/review-music-solutions-to-a-partnership-problem.html","abstract":"  Pianists in recital teams are invariably irked by the not entirely unnatural perception that they are accompanists, and that their partners who play melody instruments are the soloists.

It halted Bobby Bonilla in his tracks in right field, cleared the outfield fence, kept going right on over the plateau of ground beyond. Darryl Strawberry, months after back surgery, is healthy, dangerous and, of course, eminently quotable.   \"Has anyone asked, and can the Mets ever explain, how they could get rid of all the talent they had?\" asked Strawberry. \"The fans in New York know their baseball. I'm sure they are asking what happened to their players.\"   The players Strawberry was talking about, of course, have gone a lot of places -- into retirement, to free agency, off to other clubs in trades of debatable merit. Others have come in, and the results have not been special. The Mets, who declined to bid seriously for Strawberry after the 1990 season, have finished fifth twice since Strawberry left, and the giant contracts they have handed out to others have generated scarcely any dividends to date.   \"I don't even know who they are,\" Strawberry said of the Mets. 'New York's a Hard Town'    The club's anonymity for Strawberry is not total. He doesn't need to be reminded that Vince Coleman is there, a base-stealer signed for nearly as much as the Mets offered Strawberry. He knows full well Bobby Bonilla is in New York, under siege and all over the headlines.   \"New York's a hard town,\" said Strawberry. \"I think people, over time, have realized how tough I was.\"   He was updated on the details of Bonilla's most recent difficult week. His reaction mixed understanding and advice. It was not, however, exactly suffused with sympathy.   \"You put your hand in the fire, and that's what you are going to have to deal with,\" said Strawberry. \"He's in a fireplace. And he's making big money. They want you to put the club on your back and carry it.\"   Asked if Bonilla were up to the load, Strawberry, who bears Bonilla no personal animus, hedged.   \"You can't judge what kind of player he is,\" Strawberry said of the Mets' current right fielder. \"When the pressure is on, you have to rise above it. And I'm quite sure he's feeling a lot of pressure.\" He Has Heard That Before    He was told of Bonilla's being booed here in spring-training games.   \"It's a town that can make you or break you,\" said Strawberry. \"Hey, they booed me in spring, too. He got the big contract, I didn't. He has to learn to accept the boos.\"   Bonilla's strategy, said Strawberry, should not be to look to escape, but to, by force of will and talent, reverse it all.   \"The way you answer it is put the fans on their feet,\" said Strawberry. \"I didn't run and hide. I had my share of run-ins. But I didn't let it stop me from doing what I had to do.\"   Strawberry believes he can at long last get back to doing what he does best -- manufacturing nearly mythic home runs, like the one he hit today against Frank Tanana.   \"It's been hard days of hard work,\" said Stawberry, who underwent back surgery on Sept. 15. \"When they cut on your back, you never know what's going to happen. When they tried to get me to walk after surgery, it was scary. I thought I might never be able to walk like a normal person. But I worked my way up to be able to walk. And now, I'm almost comfortable out there.\"   Today, Strawberry sounded as if he'd be quite comfortable back in right feld at Shea. He won't be, of course. Bobby Bonilla will be there, and Strawberry had no sure prescription for making that work.   INSIDE PITCH    JOHN FRANCO, the recovering closer for the Mets, pitched to live batters Sunday for the first time this spring. \"It's almost there,\" said Franco. \"I asked the guys I faced in B.P., and they all said my velocity was there.
