The rest of the evening featured selections by Ms. Crispell without dancing and a long solo by Ms. Li set to taped scores by several composers. Ms. Crispell's music brooded, smoldered and often became fiery, and it received fine performances by a trio that included, in addition to the composer, Reggie Workman on bass and Gerry Hemingway on percussion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940224","headline":"Gastre Journal; For the Desperate, Nuclear Waste Isn't Dreadful","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/24/world/gastre-journal-for-the-desperate-nuclear-waste-isn-t-dreadful.html","abstract":"  This dusty desert town, which seems to be lost in the middle of Patagonia, fits Buenos Aires policy makers' description of a \"nonviable\" area -- one that has no economic resources to support its people and where continued Government subsidies would be too costly.

These exhibitions can create the illusion of broader horizons for the visitor, no mean task in a February like this one, enabling one to traverse a great deal of esthetic terrain in a relatively small amount of space and a minimum of weather. They provide momentary respite from winter's doldrums, when the vision narrows and the mind hunkers down.   In SoHo and on 57th Street there are shows with three or more artists at nearly every turn, in young galleries and blue-chip venues alike. Some focus on one medium; others have a thematic or formal organizing device. Most are in-house efforts, organized by dealers happy to take a break from the steady march of one-person exhibitions; a few bear the imprimatur of independent curators. And one or two even push the envelope of the group show format, suggesting that it can be a provocative art form in itself.  Paula Cooper    \"Pictures of the Real World (In Real Time),\" at the Paula Cooper Gallery (155 Wooster Street, near Houston Street), is an oddly handsome show, organized by Robert Nickas, that measures life and photography, constancy and change. The constants are the austere Conceptual Art date paintings of On Kawara, which here are something akin to wall labels. Announcing dates like \"May 6, 1972\" or \"June 9, 1985,\" these small white-on-black canvases mark off the 28 years of 1966 to 1993 and alternate with 28 photographs, one from each year.   The show's main achievement, other than to give Mr. Kawara's paintings somethings to do, is to trace photography into Conceptual Art and out the other side. It begins with Conceptualists like Dan Graham and Douglas Huebler, includes appropriation artists like Cindy Sherman, Richard Prince and Sherrie Levine and concludes with more idiosyncratic manipulators of the medium like Andres Serrano, Jeanne Dunning and Zoe Leonard. Documentary photographs, primarily by Larry Clark and Diane Arbus, are definitely in the minority. Yet in many ways, reality and how artists with cameras have insinuated it into art are the show's underlying subjects. (Through March 12.) Luhring Augustine    By its very title, \"The Ossuary,\" at Luhring Augustine (130 Prince Street), evokes two of contemporary art's most prevalent subjects: death and the body. The show, which has been organized by Diego Cortez and Arto Lindsay, brings together 26 artists, many of them the usual suspects, like Edward Ruscha, Brice Marden and Philip Taaffe, all intersecting with the show's theme from different angles and tangents. Richard Prince for example, contributes a joke painting about a funeral.   Included are \"Jawbone,\" a powerful, uncharacteristically wordless painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, and an exceptional four-panel painting by Francesco Clemente in which a seemingly living face is progressively readied for burial, winding up dead. But the show's main action is sculptural: impressive objects by Louise Bourgeois, Kiki Smith, Matthew Barney and, most startlingly, a Brazilian Candomble priest named Mestre Didi, create a garden of earthly delights centerstage. (Through March 19.) Jay Gorney    The exhibition at Jay Gorney (100 Greene Street, near Prince Street) includes works by the painter David Deutsch, the photographer James Welling and Douglas Blau, a critic, curator and expert image-gatherer who is giving appropriation art a few new twists. Mr. Deutsch's painting of a small town glimpsed through the lush overgrowth of summer trees plays off the starker realities of Mr. Welling's black-and-white photographs of old houses whose weathered exteriors and hillside settings immediately evoke the harshness of mining-town life.   In the other direction, Mr. Deutsch's \"Double Plaza\" and \"Repository,\" in which pantheons of blurry portraits invoke a rather daunting sense of cultural authority, are relieved by Mr. Blau's \"Views and Vistas.\" This work of 81 found images from sources high and low and ranging through several centuries, concentrates on isolated figures seen from the back, looking at landscapes. After Mr. Deutsch's generic evocations of human achievement, it's nice to see man and woman dwarfed by nature. (Through March 26.) Postmasters    \"Untitled,\" the group show at Postmasters (80 Greene Street, near Spring Street), presents work by five women and reminds us that, contrary to the impression created by the current exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, abstract artists, too, can be \"Bad Girls.\" All it takes is irreverence, a certain raunchiness of style or material and a healthy disregard for the lines between media. Beth Haggart constructs a huge, truculent yet buoyant sphere from cardboard boxes, while Polly Apfelbaum states the colors of the spectrum in radiant terms on strips of white velvet arranged neatly on the floor.   In an especially beautiful work that recalls the early 1970's poured-latex paintings of Lynda Benglis, Lauren Szold creates an in-progress piece of Process Art by swirling color across the floor and letting it drip from the ceiling. Nancy Rubins's rugged graphite drawings and Jessica Stockholder's bristling found-object formalism complete this impressive gathering. (Through March 19.) P.P.O.W.    \"Arabesque,\" at P.P.O.W. (532 Broadway, near Spring Street), follows the curving, undulating and occasionally curlicue lines of arabesques from artwork to artwork, which are good, bad and indifferent and mostly paintings. It gets credit for emphasizing the decorative in art of all kinds, be it the political surrealism of Frank Moore's painting \"Easter,\" with its spiral of blood, or the intimate heraldic shapes of David Moreno's untitled abstract collage.   In Lari Pittman's ferociously decorative \"Untitled No. 4 (Insist),\" the decorative and the political fuse seamlessly. Also engaging are the works of Betsy Friedman, Amy Sillman, Fred Tomaselli, Gregory Crane and Peter Nagy, who has abandoned his black and white palette for pastels. And the overall ambiance of this show -- bright, formally exuberant and, well, a little loopy -- is a pleasant change of pace. (Through March 19.) Lennon, Weinberg    \"An Exhibition in Memory of Raoul Hague,\" at Lennon, Weinberg (580 Broadway, near Prince Street), is a touching meditation on the artist's quest. It brings together six sculptures by Raoul Hague, who died last year at the age of 88, with three or four drawings or paintings each by Arshile Gorky, Bradley Walker Tomlin and Philip Guston, all of whom Hague claimed as friends and inspirers. Each artist's progress toward abstraction and an individual style is briefly indicated, starting with Tomlin's \"Tulip,\" a lovely little painting from 1930, and ending with Guston's lumpily sensuous \"Afternoon II\" of 1963.   Especially noteworthy is Hague's \"Belgian Marble,\" a 1940 sculpture of a standing female nude whose simplified forms reflect the artist's studies with William Zorach and John Flannagan. The figure's face is awkwardly schematized and its arms are poorly resolved, but the abbreviated yet gently swelling torso achieves a balance between the real and the abstract and between flesh and stone that is completely riveting. (Through tomorrow.) Thread Waxing Space    In \"Don't Look Now\" at Thread Waxing Space (476 Broadway, near Broome Street), the critic Joshua Decter creates a picture gallery that is also a slide show. In the process he demonstrates the appeal that strictly limited formats hold for curators. Mr. Decter invited 68 artists (and a few writers) to submit any work they wanted so long as it was in slide form. All are projected high on the walls of a dark narrow space, in alphabetical order.   Some artists simply sent slides of their work. Others, like Jon Kessler, who turned his slide into a work of kinetic art, have bent the format to their particular sensibilities. For some, no bending was necessary. The self-absorbed Sean Landers sent a childhood photograph, while Robert Gober is represented by a slide of an early painting from a work that consists entirely of slides of no-longer-extant early paintings. This show may be a critic's revenge on the art object, or an aside about art in the age of mechanical reproduction. But it's also great fun, perhaps in spite of itself. (Through tomorrow.) Galerie St. Etienne    Not all the artists in \"The Forgotten Folk Art of the 1940's,\" at Galerie St. Etienne (24 West 57th Street), deserve to be remembered. It doesn't seem necessary, for example, to retrieve from obscurity the sentimental, heavy-handed canvases of Abraham Levin or Lawrence Lebduska, although the latter comported himself quite well when painting fish and cactuses on small wood panels. The show is further weakened by poor examples of artists who aren't all that forgotten, like John Kane; and by so many similar snow scenes by Grandma Moses that the term cottage industry gains new meaning.   Still, it's great to see Israel Litwak's dense little landscapes in which careful patterns make every leaf and flower stand out. Also worthy of rediscovery are the paintings of Grandma Moses' younger brother, Fred Robertson, who took up the brush after his sister's success. Sibling rivalry is clearly as effective as any other artistic motivation: at least in this context, Robertson's less meticulous, more emotional landscapes and farm scenes outshine the efforts of his famous sister. (Through March 19.)  Barbara Mathes    The twain that meet in \"Alternative Visions\" at the Barbara Mathes Gallery (41 East 57th Street) are 19th-century French wallpaper and 20th-century Minimal Art, realms of artistic endeavor so disparate that one doesn't even think of them as opposites.   The meeting is more a miss than a hit, partly because many visitors to contemporary art galleries may find the wallpaper designs so unfamiliar and striking, especially in their unusual, often intense color combinations, that the efforts of Sol LeWitt, Robert Mangold, Robert Ryman and Carl Andre may simply be overlooked. There's shared territory: an emphasis on repeating forms and at times a chalky surface delicacy. But the show's only real click is the juxtaposition of three scenic panels and a stripe painting by Agnes Martin, which share a similar grisaille color scheme and sense of restraint. Otherwise, it's a nice try, with the wallpaper doing most of the work. (Through April 2.)

There she is at 17, exquisitely young; again in her 20's, and at 42. It is the face that launched dozens of films and countless male fantasies. Now, playing a rich old sensualist called Lady M., she spreads the photographs before a 25-year-old man with whom she is enamored, and asks which of them he likes best.    It is a hopeless question. When he says he likes her best in the present (he's young; he's not an idiot), she accepts it as a gracious lie. More important, the actress moves quickly past the moment and stays in character, half-trying to seduce the young man while plotting jewel heists in this quirky dark comedy (made in 1991 and never before shown in the United States).

Mr. Shearing finally escaped this sound in 1978 by dropping the quintet and forming a duo with Neil Swainson on bass. The duo shares this weekend's program with Kenny Burrell's Trio, in which Mr. Burrell joined by the bassist Marcus McLaurine and the drummer Sherman Ferguson.

According to the Abrahamic religions, the cave and adjoining field were purchased by Abraham as a burial plot, although most historians believe the Abraham-Isaac-Jacob narrative to be primarily mythological. The site is considered a holy place in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19940225","time":"1994-02-25
