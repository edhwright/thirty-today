At the Thread Waxing Space on Friday night, when this three-man band from Joshua Tree, Calif., topped a quadruple bill, a typical Giant Sand song might start out with a folky strummed guitar, move into a country-rock oompah, solidify into a hard-rock stomp or unleash a wailing, psychedelic guitar solo, dropping back into oompah now and then. The band's set also followed no fixed path as it meandered from folksiness to blare, then abandoned any momentum while Mr. Gelb decided on the next song. \"I guess we're sluggish,\" he observed halfway through an unhurried set; once a good part of the audience had left, he returned for a half-hour of more energetic encores.    Mr. Gelb's songs earn him his eccentricities. Beginning with Giant Sand's first single in 1981, he has created his own wayward updating of the 1960's. The music is steeped in Neil Young -- both the folksy simplicity and the grungy hard-rock -- but skewed toward Mr. Gelb's own timing and daydreams.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940509","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/09/nyregion/c-corrections-036498.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, a chart on Saturday of the new South African Cabinet misstated the first name of a Minister Without Portfolio.

Candlebox thanked its fans three times for coming to the concert, helped potential stage-divers climb onto the stage and held up a set of lost keys and announced that it could be picked up at the box office. This type of public service announcement usually isn't made at hard-rock shows, where there are often as many lost shoes and keys in the mosh pit as people.   Candlebox specializes in hard-rock entertainment. It plays well-rehearsed blues-infused rock-and-roll anthems that never get too indulgent or too soft. Kevin Martin, the singer, and Peter Klett, the guitarist, seem to have spent a lot of time rehearsing to Led Zeppelin records. They've also been taking lessons from alternative rock success stories like Pearl Jam and Soul Asylum.

A1  HAITI ABUSES QUESTIONED  President Clinton reaffirmed his support for the exiled President of Haiti, but a cable from the American Ambassador there has charged that the President's supporters exaggerated human rights abuses. A7  A fast over Haiti policy was worth it, an activist said. A7  THE TOLL OF WAR IN ANGOLA  In Angola's rebel stronghold, life is a struggle, with no electricity or running water and little food or medicine, but the potential wealth of the country allows one of Africa's longest civil wars to continue. A1  IMPATIENCE IN JERICHO  The Israeli occupation is supposed to end in Jericho, but so far little has changed. The first contingent of the Palestinian police force was just six miles away, though, awaiting the signal to enter the area. A1  An international force went to Hebron to keep order. A3  SOUTH AFRICA'S CHALLENGE  Two men with very different backgrounds have responsibility in South Africa's new Cabinet for a complex task: improving the lives of the new electorate while protecting the stability of the economy. A6  THE BASIC ISSUE IN BOSNIA  News Analysis: the town of Brcko, seen as the next flash point of Bosnian conflict, is also a sign of why the war is unlikely to end soon: Muslims are fighting to go home to areas cleared by the Serbs.

A1  LOOKING OUT FOR ONE'S INTERESTS  The underlying story of why the Clinton Administration backed away from a proposed gambling tax to pay for part of the welfare plan illustrates the way the capital is patrolled by vigilant, organized interest groups.  A1  CRITICISM BY GAY SERVICEMEN  The \"don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue\" policy may have made life worse for homosexuals in the military, polarizing attitudes toward homosexuals and shifting the burden of proof to service members accused of engaging in homosexual acts.  A1  SETBACK FOR DOMESTIC PARTNERS  Voters in Austin, Tex., have repealed a policy granting health benefits for the partners of homosexual and unmarried city employees, making the city the first of roughly 20 communities in the nation with such benefits to repeal its program.  A8  NEW BATTLE WAGED AT GETTYSBURG  A dispute over the loss of part of the Gettysburg battlefield is the outgrowth of a long-running debate over just how much land should be set aside in the shrine to thousands of Union and Confederate dead.  A8  DESEGREGATING HIGHER EDUCATION  At issue in a Federal trial in Oxford, Miss., is how the historically black public institutions of higher learning will be treated as their formerly all-white counterparts are often attracting the cream of the crop of black students.  A10  REACTION TO ASSAULT WEAPON BAN  One freshman Republican Congressman and his staff in mostly Democratic Long Beach, Calif., found little passion over the assault weapons bill, and most constituents, worried above all about crime, seemed to support the ban.  A12  SEXUAL HARASSMENT RE-EXAMINED  America has again been plunged into a national seminar on sexual harassment, a migraine issue full of gray areas and her-word-against-his contentions, with Prof. Anita Hill and Senator Bob Packwood now providing commentary.  A12  EMERGING FORCE IN HEALTH CARE  Robert Reischauer's Congressional Budget Office has no vote on health care legislation, but he and his team of analysts have emerged as a crucial voice in the current debate, with more influence at the moment than many lawmakers.

Powers, the Deputy Mayor for operations, is the strongest second-in-command at City Hall in years. He is the point man on both policy and on politics, roles traditionally split.

Opponents of gay and lesbian marriages assert that such unions are threats to the family and contrary to public policy. While these arguments are familiar, they seem inconsistent with today's reality.   Our society's traditionally homophobic attitudes have done more to tear apart families than gay marriages could.

The oceans are a critical part of the climate system because they absorb, store, move and eventually release heat, the system's main driving force. Mathematical models of the system predict that sea-surface temperatures should rise by 3 to 7 degrees if, as many scientists expect, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide double in the next 100 years. The gas, which traps heat in the atmosphere, is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940510","headline":"Chess","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/10/arts/chess-048038.html","abstract":"  Quick play is the current wave splashing over the chess world.

He was also an imponderable legend; in the 1960's he was asked for an autograph by a man who turned out to be Frank Sinatra.   The Brooklyn program made a selection from Stravinsky's plurality of selves. Far more serious and cohesive than standard-issue thematic programming, the series drew on recent researches into the Russian national roots of Stravinsky's early radical period (1909-1917). The musicologist Richard Taruskin presented conclusions from his unpublished study \"Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions.\" And the Pokrovsky Ensemble of Moscow, a group that re-enacts peasant singing and dancing, demonstrated the folk sources of \"The Rite of Spring,\" \"Renard\" and \"Les Noces.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940510","headline":"Moscow Journal; Where Politicians Sometimes Tote Assault Rifles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/10/world/moscow-journal-where-politicians-sometimes-tote-assault-rifles.html","abstract":"  In the early morning on a not quite empty city street a week ago, two men fired at each other with Kalashnikov assault rifles in a shootout that left one of the gunmen, a reputed member of organized crime, dead.

Almost half a century has passed since he wrote criticism regularly -- he gave up his post as a reviewer for The Nation magazine in 1949 -- but he remains at once the most admired and excoriated writer on art, as much a touchstone of postwar American painting and sculpture as any of the painters and sculptors in whose circle he moved as an oracular presence.   Why is he still so potent a figure? The reasons are many; it is not simply that he backed the right horses, by identifying before others did the painter Jackson Pollock and the sculptor David Smith as the ones on which America should stake its claim to artistic primacy after the war. He did back them, strongly and effectively, and even at the risk of a certain critical inconsistency. He often repeated his suspicion of Surrealism and his dislike of art that he saw as violent and horrific, yet both Pollock and Smith were undeniably indebted to Surrealism.

Box turtles by the thousands are being killed each year as the result of a booming wildlife trade that sends them to Europe as pets, say scientists, conservationists and officials on both sides of the Atlantic. Many die or are greatly weakened when jam-packed together without food or water for shipping, and many more succumb to an unsuitable European climate and to mistreatment by pet sellers and owners ignorant of the turtles' needs, they say.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940510","headline":"Clinton, Visiting Manhattan, Says Medicaid Should Pay More in States Like New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/10/us/clinton-visiting-manhattan-says-medicaid-should-pay-more-in-states-like-new-york.html","abstract":"  President Clinton said yesterday for the first time that the formula for distributing Federal Medicaid money should be changed to provide larger amounts to states like New York with large numbers of poor people.

There is one sure way for Commander in Chief Clinton and the Pentagon to stop this betrayal of the new policy: punish any commander who defies it, severely.   The new policy -- a compromise hammered out by the Administration, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Congress -- falls far short of President Clinton's original goal of allowing homosexuals to serve openly. Instead, it bans homosexual conduct and tolerates gay service members only if their orientation remains covert.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940510","headline":"Q&A","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/10/science/q-a-050318.html","abstract":"  Brothers and Others   Q.

If the Devils, who lead the four-of-seven-game series, 3-2, can eliminate the Bruins from the Stanley Cup playoffs, they would have a date with the Rangers in the Eastern Conference finals starting on Sunday at Madison Square Garden. Should the Devils lose, Brodeur would guard the Devils' goal in Game 7 on Friday night at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, where he stopped all 22 shots the Bruins fired at him Monday night in New Jersey's 2-0 victory. Seeking an Edge    In these playoffs, coaches and players seek any kind of an edge. That is why Lemaire turned to a goalie tandem in the midst of a series. The coach's assumptions were that Brodeur, the 22-year-old rookie who had played well in nine straight games, might be somewhat worn and that Terreri would regard Boston Garden as an old friend.    The Bruins beat the Devils and Brodeur in the first two games here and then New Jersey won twice at Boston, with Terreri playing back-to-back games for the first time since March 12-13.    Terreri, from Warwick, R.I., said today that he was first taken to the Boston Garden at age 6 by his father for a Bruins game. He knows well the tight rink with little skating space behind the goal from having played there so often in five full seasons with the Devils and in Hockey East games while he played for Providence College.    \"Chris is confident,\" said Lemaire. \"And the players are confident in Chris.\"   Terreri dismisses the reality that his playing time all but disappeared in the last weeks of the regular season. He's flattered that his coach turned to him when the Devils went to Boston down 2-0. 'I'm Having Fun'    \"We were fighting for our lives,\" said Terreri. \"Of course, you want to play. But you respect what he says.    \"I'm thrilled I got a chance to help in the playoffs, that I've got a chance to win this series. It's a team game and I'm having fun.\"   Terreri added that he is as comfortable as he can be for Game 6 and that his teammates want to end the series Wednesday night.   \"Nobody wants to come back here Friday,\" said Terrari.   And nobody is mentioning the Rangers, just yet.    Lemaire's intentions with his two goaltenders in this series were always apparent to Terreri, who approved of them. \"It gives this team another dimension,\" Terreri said. Defensive Gem    According to Lemaire, the Devils played \"probably our best game defensively\" on Monday night.   The teams played evenly with swift up-and-down movement through the first period. After the first goal, by Corey Millen at 1 minute 23 seconds of the second period, Lemaire said: \"There was a difference. At that moment we started to take charge. I could feel it on the bench.\"   With 22 seconds remaining in the period, Bobby Carpenter and Claude Lemieux caught the Bruins on a 2-on-1 break. Lemieux passed the puck to Carpenter, who shot it from near the top of the right circle over Boston goaltender Jon Casey's glove.   The Devils tied up the Bruins at center ice much of the time and Adam Oates, Boston's great set-up man, all but disappeared. The Boston version, as expressed by Coach Brian Sutter, was that the Bruins stood around too much and stopped skating.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/11/style/chronicle-064041.html","abstract":"  ELIZABETH DE CROY, the Princess of Solre, a descendant of Hungarian kings from the Holy Roman Empire, has a mission that has occupied her for almost 25 years.

It takes an optimistic nature to believe his administration can raise the city bureaucracy's productivity enough to sustain services while reducing the number of employees. But, as the Mayor points out, he has already accomplished some things his critics claimed could not be done. Most notably, he has persuaded unions to accept a severance plan for city employees and to give him extraordinary authority to transfer employees between agencies.   The budget Mr. Giuliani submitted to the City Council yesterday was his formal plan for fiscal 1995, starting July 1. He faced an awesome $2.3 billion deficit -- the largest since the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's. And closing the gap is made more difficult by the public's rebellion against further tax increases. In contrast to predecessors who raised taxes, the Mayor opts to cut them -- only $35 million next year, but $260 million the year after, and more after that. He includes long-overdue relief for apartment owners, who pay higher taxes than owners of houses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"Civic Duty Calls.

It's got the leggy showgirls, the glowing neon, the costumes cut up to here and down to there, the M.C. with the frilly tuxedo shirt, the clink-clink-clink of slot machines paying off, and Siegfried and Roy (portrayed by one actor, half of whom is made up as Siegfried, the other half as Roy).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"President Mandela Takes Over","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/11/opinion/l-president-mandela-takes-over-064203.html","abstract":"  Inaugurations unite winners and losers, proclaim new eras and provide a snapshot, a moment frozen in time, for a huge audience. Nelson Mandela's inaugural in Cape Town yesterday was all of that and more. Over a billion television viewers around the world, surely a record in this department, saw him take the oath as South Africa's first black President. It was like being alive in the time of Lincoln, whose great address Mr. Mandela echoed in affirming that South Africans finally had a government of, by and for the people.    Most remarkable was the orderly way in which old white political citadels fell overnight to new black majorities in both national and provincial parliaments. Former prisoners mingled civilly with their erstwhile oppressors, and new anthems and flags became part of the rites. In a striking and moving gesture, Mr. Mandela even paused to thank the white warders who had become his friends during his 27 years in prison, forming a bond that surmounted the walls of apartheid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940511","time":"1994-05-11
