Hunter-gatherers who settled along the Jordan River valley managed to domesticate wild progenitors of wheat and barley as early as 9,000 to 10,000 years ago, and thus became, as far as anyone knows, the first farmers anywhere.

IN CITY HOSPITALS, CHAOTIC BUREAUCRACY   When New York City's public hospitals underwent their last major reorganization more than 25 years ago, civic leaders renewed a longstanding promise to bring medical care for the poor up to the standards of the best private hospitals. The system that emerged is now under attack for both its ideology and its cost. But long before the change in political sentiment, New York's public hospitals were moving toward a crisis of their own making, with problems that had a familiar ring. A1. ALLEGATIONS OF CO-OP FRAUD   Year after year, the retirees and working-class families who live in the Big Six Towers cooperative in Queens dutifully paid their monthly maintenance fees. And with the promise of great earnings, many even invested their life savings in a plan to expand Big Six's shopping center. But the stunned residents of the Big Six have now learned that they may never recover their investments. A1. NEW YORK CITY  COUNCIL ASSAILS MAYOR ON HOSPITALS   Several City Council leaders assailed Mayor Giuliani's philosophy on hospital privatization, attacking the Mayor's contention that a high death rate among newborn babies in New York City public hospitals demonstrated the need for the city to sell some hospitals.

But on Sunday afternoon at Avery Fisher Hall, Mr. Spivakov and his pianist, Sergei Bezrodny, offered a view of Mozart's Sonata in G (K. 379) -- or at least, its Adagio -- that had a late Beethovenian expansiveness. Its opening piano chords were not merely rolled but were also suffused with dramatic portent, an effect that Mr. Spivakov turned to his advantage at the violin line's entrance.    Throughout the Adagio, Mr. Spivakov played with a rich, centered tone and a focused, thoughtfully regulated vibrato. The Allegro and the closing variations were slightly leaner and more conventionally Mozartean, although Mr. Spivakov's singing tone, the breadth of his coloristic palette and his interaction with Mr. Bezrodny remained the reading's principal attractions. Similar charms enlivened the extroverted reading of Schubert's Fantasie in C (D. 934), which closed the program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19950307","time":"1995-03-07

The body burns calories more slowly than normal after weight is lost, and faster than normal when weight is gained, the study found. This means it is harder both to lose and, perhaps surprising to some, to gain weight than to maintain the same level. In the study, researchers found that in volunteers who gained weight, metabolism was speeded up by 10 percent to 15 percent, and in those who lost weight, metabolism was 10 percent to 15 percent slower than normal. The volunteers, both female and male, ranged in age from their 20's to their 40's, but the effect on metabolism was independent of age and sex.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950309","headline":"New Jersey Daily Briefing; Probation for Ex-Judge in Theft","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/09/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-probation-for-ex-judge-in-theft.html","abstract":"  A former state judge in Somerset County who admitted stealing $173,000 from his partners in a real estate venture was sentenced yesterday to five years' probation.

To illustrate why psychiatric financing should not be cut back, Dr. Klitzman recounts what can be called a \"violent mania\" story: a patient who hears voices ordering him to kill. Dr. Klitzman in effect inflames the public's fear of the \"mentally ill\" in order to gain more public support for psychiatry. This is a cheap dramatic technique with a devastating long-term impact. It increases the public's fear of people labeled mentally ill, reinforces the humiliating stigma and discourages any genuine empathy toward them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950309","headline":"School Lunch Bill Leaves Out Military Children","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/09/us/school-lunch-bill-leaves-out-military-children.html","abstract":"  When a House committee voted last month to scrap the national school lunch program and let states decide how to use Federal money to feed pupils, it forgot about a large group of needy young diners.
