Pataki PRODUCER: Russo, Marsh & Associates, Sacramento, Calif., and Alexandria, Va. VISUAL: Photographs of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Shoreham nuclear plant, plus newspaper headlines and highlights of the script over ominous music. Ends with photograph of Mr. Cuomo scratching his head. SCRIPT: Announcer: \"First, Mario Cuomo cut a cynical deal to buy votes with a $9 billion bailout of Lilco. Now he's cut another deal -- for Rudy Giuliani's support. Just three days after Giuliani's endorsement, The New York Times reported that Giuliani is already counting on $150 million more of your state tax dollars. Billions for Lilco, hundreds of millions for Giuliani and tax increases for us. Don't let Mario Cuomo buy this election with your money.\" ACCURACY: The Governor has proposed a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, which would cost about $9 billion, to be financed through tax-exempt bonds. Politicians of many stripes and the financial markets greeted the idea skeptically. Mr. Cuomo contends a takeover would lead to lower electric rates, by eliminating shareholder dividends and Federal taxes the utility now pays. Mayor Giuliani's proposed budget modification, announced a day after his endorsement of the Governor, does depend on $150 million in new aid from Albany, although he and Mr. Cuomo insist they never discussed any deal, and no governor can deliver much in the way of state aid without the cooperation of the Legislature. Mr. Cuomo has proposed no tax increases. SCORECARD: Mr. Pataki is vulnerable to the charge -- by Mr. Giuliani and other local officials -- that his proposed state income tax cuts would force higher local taxes. This ad tries to turn that attack around, arguing that Mr. Cuomo is the taxer who is pitting different parts of the state against each other. In making that claim, of course, Mr. Pataki seeks to divide the state further, and energize his base in the upstate areas that have provided a growing share of the electorate.  The ad's anti-tax message could hit home, as does its suggestion that the Lilco plan is an election-year gambit. But its conspiracy theory may strike voters as hard to believe, and it does nothing to sketch in Mr. Pataki's own personality or ideas. TODD S.

Cuomo (paid for by the New York State Democratic Committee) PRODUCER Axelrod & Associates, Chicago and Washington ON THE SCREEN Black-and-white scenes of State Senator George E. Pataki, Pat Robertson and a newspaper headline reading \"George is 100 percent 'right' according to Pat Robertson,\" then of assault weapons laid out together, as white letters on black background come zooming into view to highlight parts of script over ominous music. SCRIPT Announcer: \"The more you learn about George Pataki's friends, the more you wonder. As a State Senator, Pataki won the top rating from Pat Robertson's radical coalition, which preaches a ban on abortion and wants creationism taught in our schools. And now, the National Rifle Association's endorsed Pataki, who's opposed tougher gun laws, like the ban on assault weapons. The N.R.A., Pat Robertson and the radical right. If George Pataki's their man, can he really be ours?\" ACCURACY In 1993, Mr. Pataki did receive a 100 percent rating from the Christian Coalition, based on four votes: Medicaid funding for abortions, a bill that finances the Medicaid program through aid to local governments, the section of the budget that provided for postponing scheduled tax cuts and a bill on child pornography. This year, his rating was 83 percent. Mr. Pataki supports abortion rights, though he has voted consistently for restrictions. He says he supports a ban on assault weapons, but in April he voted against an amendment to a gun-licensing bill that included sharp restrictions on a number of assault weapons. At first, he denied the vote, then said it was procedural and now says it was a partisan vote with the Republican majority on a measure that did not go far enough. SCORECARD This is one of the harshest ads of the race, produced and paid for by the State Democratic Committee in part because the Governor's media adviser, David Garth, has opposed making such attacks. But for weeks now, Mr. Cuomo has sought to define Mr. Pataki as out of step with a state that retains a strong plurality of Democratic voters likely to reject a strongly conservative candidate, and polls suggest the Governor's attacks have been working. The risk is that the imputed link between Mr. Pataki and the Christian right is tenuous, and voters may be put off by the tough tone. TODD S.

In an era of sharp cutbacks in government services, and when entitlement programs soak up ever greater portions of government budgets, the net burden of high levels of immigration can no longer be supported. The sentiments of Emma Lazarus's anthem -- to send us your huddled masses -- are simply no longer economically possible or desirable.   American incomes have been stagnant for the last 20 years. The taxpaying population is in revolt and any new taxes to support transfer payments and new social programs are not politically feasible. The impact of population growth on cities and states is demonstrable.   California estimates that the net cost of illegal immigration to the state's taxpayers is more than $3.5 billion. In New York City, the school population has grown by more than 20 percent in the last three years, a phenomenon that is almost entirely immigration-driven.    While immigrants do contribute to the economy, their net impact is negative, especially if they cannot enter the more skilled professions. As welfare reform becomes more urgent, the competition and friction between illegal immigrants and citizens who must integrate into the work force at lower skill levels will become more intense.   The country can no longer support the present legal immigration of 700,000 people annually, let alone illegal immigration levels that push total annual immigration into the millions. Quality of life and environmental and economic realities dictate that even our current population of 260 million consumes too much of the earth's limited resources.   A halt to illegal immigration and a reduction of legal immigration are urgently needed. If both can be accomplished, the natural birth rate of the United States will eventually reverse our population to more sustainable levels.    You place misty-eyed ideology before hard reality in attacking California's Proposition 187. Some of its provisions may be unconstitutional, but its real import is that it is placing the question of out-of-control immigration policy squarely in the center of public discourse where it belongs.

The auction house expects it to sell for about $1.42 million, roughly the price the manuscript of Schumann's Piano Concerto brought in November 1989. The record price for the sale of classical music manuscripts was set in 1987, when nine Mozart symphonies sold for $4.5 million. The manuscript will be on display at Sotheby's in New York City from Tuesday to Friday next week.   If the score is acquired by a library and comes under scholarly scrutiny, it could yield at least subtle changes in the way the music is performed, since it includes alterations and corrections Schumann made as late as 1853.

A 17-knot wind, far brisker than the 5-6 knots that prevailed at the first two races of the championship, made the fight for first place all the more dramatic. One Australia crossed the start line prematurely, and had to re-round. In the meantime, America  was off to a clean start, well ahead of One Australia on the right side of the course.

From 1975 to the early 1980's, Earth Wind and Fire was one of the most popular bands on Earth, singing about love and backing its utopian wishes with music that fused gospel sentiments, funk syncopation, pop melody, jazz harmonies and Latin rhythms. At its peak, Earth Wind and Fire came up with music that was both ingenious and embracing, proffering hope and reassurance through cross-cultural synergy. It was generous music, with an abundance of harmonizing voices and deftly deployed horns. But it couldn't stand up to the corrosive 1980's, when best-selling black pop polarized into bare-bones, confrontational hip-hop or plush come-ons.   Now, Earth Wind and Fire is an oldies act, but still popular enough to sell out two nights at the Beacon Theater. \"We're going to take you back to the 70's,\" Philip Bailey declared on Tuesday. It's a reconstituted band. Maurice White, the band's founder, producer and main songwriter, no longer tours with it; he has taken with him his kalimba, the African thumb piano that was a band trademark. Along with Mr. Bailey, the current lineup includes only two other longtime members, Verdine White on bass and Ralph Johnson on vocals and percussion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941103","headline":"Immortal Latin : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/03/opinion/IHT-immortal-latin-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"The students of the Latin classes at the International School of Brussels and I, their teacher, have read with interest \"Latin, in the Computer Age, Shows Signs of Resuscitating\" (American Topics, Oct. 5) about the renewed interest in Latin in","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941103","headline":"3 Iranians Go on Trial in France in Slaying of Exiled Ex-Premier","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/03/world/3-iranians-go-on-trial-in-france-in-slaying-of-exiled-ex-premier.html","abstract":"  In a case that has already strained relations between Paris and Teheran, three Iranians went on trial here today for the 1991 slaying of Shahpur Bakhtiar, an exiled former Iranian Prime Minister.

The festival got off to an intriguing start on Oct. 8 with a program that featured a concert by Vytautas Landsbergis, the piano-playing first president of free Lithuania. But \"Drama 20/21,\" a comprehensive tribute to Fluxus that suggested both its history and its meaning today, promises to have been the oddest event in the festival.

It offered a series of high jinks on a stage covered with electronic equipment, preserved for posterity by an audience armed with still and video cameras and tape recorders.

defendants. Unlike most cities, New York contracts the work to a private organization, the Legal Aid Society. Despite a history of dedication to an often thankless job, the society has grown fat with age. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has correctly chosen to pare the fat. That will cause the society financial pain. But it may also bring about new ways of dealing with the city's immense criminal caseloads and better justice at lower cost.    Two factors moved the society into the Mayor's line of fire. One was the city's budget crunch. The other was the society's foolish two-day strike in September. The strike, which Mr. Giuliani halted with a threat to fire the society, strengthened his hand just at budget time. Now he calls for a cheaper system -- $12.5 million less than the current budget of $79 million -- and a modern legal services contract to replace the one first signed in 1966.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"THE MOVIE GUIDE : Il Mostro","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/style/IHT-the-movie-guide-il-mostro.html","abstract":"Il Mostro.

The show, organized by the Winnipeg Art Gallery in Manitoba, brings together 14 Latin American artists, several of whom have shown in New York. They are an eclectic bunch, often thought-provoking, in one case genuinely exciting. But neither the specific works nor the essays in the show's vague, buzzword-filled catalogue suggests why they were deemed suitable company.   Given the lack of a unifying theme, one is left to judge the artists one by one, and generally speaking, the lighter their touch the better they look. It's refreshing to encounter a political metaphor as understated as Maria Fernanda Cardoso's \"Flag,\" a checkerboard pattern of guava candies forming an emblem both sweet and insubstantial, or to find gender issues as deftly explored as they are in the work of Jose Leonilson, whose crudely sewn dresses and wall hangings stitched with provocative inscriptions are \"women's work\" quietly in revolt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Jury Recommends Death Penalty for Abortion Foe Convicted in 2 Killings in Florida","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/us/jury-recommends-death-penalty-for-abortion-foe-convicted-2-killings-florida.html","abstract":"  A jury recommended today that Paul J.

His signature style is the clear-sighted film that serenely explores emotional and social upheavals, like \"Diary of a Country Priest,\" the 1950 tale of a quiet priest's religious crises. \"The Devil, Probably\" is a late, little-known Bresson film that takes the same calm approach to a world crumbling from the inside out. The film was shown at the 1977 New York Film Festival, then virtually disappeared from the United States until today, when it begins a weeklong run at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.    The film, set in contemporary Paris, begins with a newspaper account of a young man's suicide, then flashes back to the final six months of his life. Charles is 20 and in despair over a meaningless life. With his head hanging down, and his long hair parted in the center and hanging over his face like curtains, he seems a fragile, Christ-like creature. He has lost interest in the causes that consume his closest friends. One leads an environmental group; another hands out anti-clerical pamphlets in church.

VIRGINIA -- Two new polls show that the race for Senate in Virginia is still unsettled in the final days and Senator Charles S. Robb may be gaining ground. Both suggest that the Democratic incumbent has overtaken his Republican challenger, Oliver L. North, but the leads are within the statistical margin of sampling error. The surveys were conducted by the Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research company and the Virginia Commonwealth University. Scott Keeter, a director of the Virginia Commonwealth poll, said that the most notable difference in the last two polls was a decline in the percentage of voters who said they trust Mr. North to tell the truth -- from 37 percent last month to 26 percent this time. One explanation, Dr. Keeter said, could be Nancy Reagan's comment last week that Mr. North \"lied to my husband and lied about him.\" MICHIGAN -- Detroit's largest black-owned newspaper, The Michigan Chronicle, has sent shock waves through state political circles by endorsing Gov. John Engler, a conservative Republican, for re-election on its front page.

Indeed, he received only 13 percent of the vote in Detroit in 1990.

The play, which predates the films directed by Mr. Branagh, takes place in the mid-1980's, when the strife in Belfast was worse than it is today. One way Tommy has avoided being caught up in the warfare that divides the city is by spinning a fantasy of himself as a latter-day Cagney character. In the play's opening scene, he wins a talent contest in a bar by doing an impersonation of the Hollywood legend singing and dancing \"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\" But it quickly becomes clear that Tommy's identification with Cagney is more than a crowd-pleasing daydream.

Then New Yorkers began a torrid affair with the spicy Sichuan cuisine, which arrived in the late 1960's and early 70's.   Alas, the institutionalization of Sichuan food bred boredom, and culinary wanderlust struck again. A return to Cantonese, perhaps, with its noodle and dumpling specialties? A flirtation with Fukienese, a dalliance with Shanghaiese? And then maybe even a return to Sichuan?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19941104","time":"1994-11-04
