One can talk of admirable works for solo cello by Reger, Kodaly, Hindemith and Ligeti, but it was Britten who approached the unapproachable, writing utterly private music that thought aloud in intermingling confessional voices.   Like all of Britten's late cello pieces, the Third Suite was written for Mstislav Rostropovich; with its filigree of Russian quotations and huge passacaglia climax, it also has strong links to the music of Shostakovich. Mr. Rostropovich ceased performing the work in public after Britten's death, finding the personal associations too difficult to bear, but other cellists have confronted its great technical as well as emotional challenges. Colin Carr, who performed the Suite alongside Kodaly's solo Sonata at the Kaye Playhouse on Tuesday night, knows the idiom as well as any.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940407","headline":"Small Businesses Certainly Do Create Jobs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/07/opinion/l-small-businesses-certainly-do-create-jobs-705098.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Myth: Small Business as Job Engine\" (Business Day, March 25) tries to make the case that large companies are at least as proficient as small ones at job creation.

On a bad night they can make a listener thank punk rock for plowing guitar-playing windbags six feet under. The band's show at the Beacon Theater on Tuesday night veered between the two extremes, and for the most part the audience loved it all. Punk rock may have completely altered the rock landscape, but the Allman Brothers, who finish an eight-night, sold-out stand at the Beacon this weekend, don't seem to care, and neither does the band's adoring audience.   The group sells the sound of the guitar, and all the freedom and wildness that, in rock, the instrument implies. Over the years the band has been transformed from a sleek and swinging group to something more ponderous. The jazz influences have given way to a rock heaviness, and at Tuesday's show the music had its bloated and slow moments, sounding thick around the middle. At times Warren Haynes, who has completely absorbed the sound of Duane Allman, the group's original guitarist, pulled together solos of melodic beauty; he and the group's other guitarist, Dickey Betts, aren't afraid of using major scales to produce melodies. At other times he just kept making the same point over and over.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940407","headline":"Casillas Joins Chiefs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/07/sports/sports-people-football-casillas-joins-chiefs.html","abstract":"  The Kansas City Chiefs signed TONY CASILLAS, an unrestricted free agent, to a four-year, $6 million contract and released running back HARVEY WILLIAMS, a former No. 1 draft pick.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940407","headline":"In Italy, the Right Wing Squabbles Over Spoils","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/07/world/in-italy-the-right-wing-squabbles-over-spoils.html","abstract":"  The rift in Italy's victorious, right-wing electoral alliance widened today as Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate who led the voting in last month's national elections, threatened to force a new ballot, while his nominal ally appealed to other political parties for support in his campaign to change the country from a republic to a federation.

To prove it, you have only to go to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where the Matisse mural of 1932-33 from the Barnes Collection is now on view. That this majestic achievement should be there at all is a historic reversal of the famously bad relations that had prevailed between the Barnes Collection and the Philadelphia Museum during the lifetime of Dr. Albert Barnes.

Whether it is the best use of police resources or the most effective way to get students back to school remains to be seen. But the problem it addresses is real.    On any given day, about 15 percent of the city's 1.1 million students are absent from school. Some absences are legitimate, many are not.

Musicians work better warmed up, and performances build not in the chronology of sound bites, but at length. The show, which was meant to be packaged for PBS, kept the performances short and sandwiched between simple introductions read by the hosts Vanessa Williams and Herbie Hancock. And musicians were hustled on and off stage for virtually every tune, destroying any sense of continuity.   Still, the concert, more than three hours long and heavy with jazz stars, had moments of real beauty. Meant to cover a good portion of the label's history, from its founder Norman Granz's first concert in 1944 to the contemporary fusion it sells today, the show almost by definition had to wrestle with Verve's immense history as well as the paucity of the original performers. Verve is lucky: it has spent a good portion of the last several years cultivating older musicians, and on occasion they came through.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940408","headline":"Starks Pushing For Playoffs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/08/sports/starks-pushing-for-playoffs.html","abstract":"  Less than a month after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, John Starks was on the Madison Square Garden court, gingerly taking jump shots before last night's Knicks-Cavaliers game.

Period costume drama, elegantly produced, has returned triumphantly to British television, which in turn, of course, means our own \"Masterpiece Theater.\" \"Middlemarch\" begins a six-week run Sunday on the PBS series.    The British enthusiasm is quite understandable. Apart from providing a whopping good story with romances and schemings to spare, George Eliot -- a pen name for Mary Ann Evans, who thought, correctly, she would have more literary acceptance with a man's name -- creates in astonishing detail an enclosed English village in which it was still possible to \"make one's way,\" by hook or crook. Everyone knew everyone else. Accents might vary but all faces were white. People knew their place. Society might have its faults, but there was no doubt that England represented civilization at its most advanced. Returning from a trip to France, where they ate odd things like frogs legs and snails, one character heartily digs into a real meal of beef and ale.

Mr. Ehrlich and Mr. Strickland go back to the early 1970's, and together they're about as empathetic as any two musicians working; they're backed by the bassist Michael Formanek and the drummer Bobby Previte.

After a couple of those, you may not be able to pay much attention to the food, which includes all manner of California classics, from an impeccable Caesar salad to several pizzas topped with exotic ingredients.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940408","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR (folo)","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/08/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-folo.html","abstract":"Regarding the report \"U.S. Bishop Backs Flogging in Singapore\" (April 6):I applaud Bishop Montgomery Griffith-Mair for expressing what millions of law-abiding citizens are thinking about Michael Fay's caning sentence in Singapore..Of course","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940408","headline":"But in Singapore Peaceful Citizens Feel Safe; Privy Council Recourse","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/08/opinion/l-but-in-singapore-peaceful-citizens-feel-safe-privy-council-recourse-717070.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The denial of Michael Fay's appeal by the Criminal Appeals Division of Singapore's Supreme Court is subject to appeal, through a mechanism of colonial vintage, to the Judicial Committee of Britain's House of Lords Privy Council, sitting in London.

An African film festival is especially welcome because of the infrequency with which African films are shown here commercially. (The Ethiopian-financed \"Sankofa,\" opening today at the Harlem Victoria Five Theater, is a notable exception.) It's also welcome because Africa's diverse cultures offer such a wealth of thematic possibilities and because so many of these little-known works happen to be so good.    The series includes 11 first features along with a couple of old favorites, like the 1990 \"Tilai\" from Idrissa Ouedraogo, the film maker from Burkina Faso whose works have the eloquence and simplicity of folk tales. The films, from 13 countries, deal with subjects as diverse as life in pre-colonial Africa (Gaston Kabore's \"Wend Kuuni,\" Burkina Faso, 1982) to the romance between an African student and his Russian lover (Abderrahmane Sissako's \"October,\" a 37-minute work from Mauritania, 1992).

Patrick Ewing missed tonight's game with the flu. And the Knicks fell behind by 20 points in the first half.   Yet, New York trailed the Philadelphia 76ers by only 3 points on the game's final possession, needing only a 3-pointer to send the game into overtime. - Unfortunately for the Knicks, there were no last-second heroics. Rolando Blackman missed what would have been a game-tying 3-pointer from 24 feet with three seconds to play. Derek Harper deflected the rebound to Hubert Davis, who also missed a top-of-the-key jumper that would have been ruled a 2-pointer as the final buzzer sounded.   Thus, New York (52-21) dropped a frustrating 100-97 decision at the Spectrum, and lost a chance to capture its second consecutive Atlantic Division title. The Knicks' magic number for the division crown remained one, meaning they can win the division if the Orlando Magic loses at Miami on Saturday night, or if the Knicks defeat the Nets at Byrne Meadowlands Arena on Sunday afternoon.   Meanwhile, New York's lead over the Atlanta Hawks was cut to one and a half games in the race for best record in the Eastern Conference.   Ewing was in the locker room after the game, and said that he would play against the Nets. But he was obviously weak, and he may not be 100 percent Sunday. Ewing felt sick on Thursday, but his condition worsened gradually this afternoon. When it was time for the team to leave the hotel for the arena, Ewing was too sick to go.   \"I just feel sick, clammy,\" said Ewing, who watched part of the game at the team's hotel before coming to the arena. \"I'm still weak.\"   Yet, the Knicks felt they would have won without Ewing, if not for their poor first half. Certainly, New York never gave up against a 76er team (23-51) that played one of its best games of the season.   The Knicks appeared to be finished when Jeff Malone's baseline jumper gave Philadelphia a 97-92 lead with 1 minute 1 second to play. But Greg Anthony wouldn't quit. Anthony's driving layup pulled the Knicks to within 97-94 with 48.6 seconds to play. Then after Malone made only 1 of 2 free throws, Anthony made a 3-point jumper from the top of the key with 18.4 seconds to play, pulling the Knicks to within 98-97.   Greg Graham made two free throws with 11.1 seconds to play to set up the final sequence. After the inbounds pass, the ball was swung to Blackman, who head-faked Clarence Weatherspoon (26 points, 10 rebounds), set his feet, then let fly. Blackman thought the shot might fall, but it was short.   \"I got a good look at it, but the ball didn't go where I wanted it to: in the basket,\" Blackman said.   After Harper tipped the rebound to Davis, his shot went in and out at the buzzer. But the referees ruled that Davis's shot would have counted for 2 points even if it had gone in. So for the Knicks, their furious second-half rally was too little, too late.   Charles Oakley led the Knicks with 18 points and 18 rebounds.   \"We just dug ourselves a hole too deep,\" said Coach Pat Riley. \"It was a tough loss, considering what's at stake and what we're playing for. You can use any excuse you want. Yes, it hurt us not to have Patrick. It hurt us a lot. But we couldn't wallow in it.\" Plenty of Knicks Fans","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940409","headline":"The State of the State, Proudly Restated; Cuomo Writes the Book on New York's Strengths, and (Surprise!)

O'Neal's first dunk, 1 minute 38 seconds into the game, shook the shot clock so violently that it quit working for the rest of the half.   Rookie Anfernee Hardaway had 26 points, 9 rebounds and 9 assists for the Magic, which also solidified its hold on the fourth seeding in the Eastern Conference and home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. They are three games in front of Cleveland with nine games to play. (AP) Bullets 108, Cavaliers 98: Rex Chapman scored 29 points and Don MacLean had 26 points and 12 rebounds as Washington prevented visiting Cleveland from clinching a playoff berth. Gerald Wilkins scored 21 points and John Williams finished with 18 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who will clinch their fourth straight playoff berth with a victory or a Charlotte loss. (AP) Bulls 100, Pacers 94: In Indianapolis, Scottie Pippen's 3-pointer with 42 seconds left highlighted a 9-0 run as Chicago took advantage of Indiana's five turnovers in the final 1:40.

Audette's crossing pass bounced off the stick of Canadiens' defenseman Patrice Brisebois and into the net. (AP) Flames 5, Sharks 2: Calgary helped determine San Jose's playoff berth.

But he had a more impressive calling card than any reputation as a competition maverick. Based in France rather than the United States, he has made an acclaimed series of recordings for the Harmonia Mundi label, covering repertory from Rossini to Prokofiev. His new recording of Mendelssohn piano sonatas is among the handsomest piano releases of the year.   Like many well-drilled Juilliard graduates, Mr. Chiu has a powerful, note-perfect technique. He showed it to good advantage in Prokofiev's Sixth Sonata and in \"Une Barque sur l'Ocean\" and \"Alborada del Gracioso\" by Ravel. Far more rare, there is real grace in his playing, an inborn elegance in his shaping of musical phrases. This he showed not only in the beguilingly atmospheric Ravel but also in the sharp-textured Prokofiev; he finds the lyric strand in Prokofiev's idiom that most pianists trample underfoot. Alongside the mighty sonata, he played his own arrangement of four pieces from \"Lieutenant Kije,\" languid to a fault but fully sympathetic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940409","headline":"BRIEFCASE: 2 Funds Reopen To New Investors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/09/your-money/IHT-briefcase-2-funds-reopen-to-new-investors.html","abstract":"One encouraging note amid the turmoil of the U.S. stock market last week: On Wednesday, the Mutual Shares and Mutual Qualified funds, two top \"value\" oriented funds, reopened to new investors.
