But exciting things are also happening in another corner of the Kretchmer empire. After trying out a couple of different chefs, One Fifth has settled in with Gary Robins, a talented 28-year-old who is turning out really impressive food.   Anybody who likes raw shellfish should try his enormous plateau de fruits de mer, a delicious tangle of large shrimps, clams, oysters, crayfish, Dungeness crabs and delicate pink scallops presented on a bed of ice. His cooked food is extremely cross-cultural: the menu offers foie gras (with pears, celery root and walnuts), ceviche (made with snapper, avocados and cilantro), caviar (with corn blini and creme fraiche), steamed red snapper (with black beans, ginger and shiitake mushrooms) and a Thai-accented green curry with giant prawns and clams. Reading through this menu is like taking a culinary trip around the world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940415","headline":"Leading Pickets, the Teamster Chief's Future May Also Be on the Line","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/us/leading-pickets-the-teamster-chief-s-future-may-also-be-on-the-line.html","abstract":"  Three years ago, Ron Carey, a bodyguard at his side, drove an old Chevrolet to teamster locals around the nation in a grass-roots campaign for the presidency of an institution that had became a national symbol of corruption and brass knuckles.

In the competitive New York City hotel market, it is seeking out visitors from California (only the wealthy or those with hefty expense accounts need apply). Yet it's not, perhaps, visitors from the West Coast who would feel the most comfortable at the Sherry-Netherland. It's those from Europe.   Not that there's too much to grumble about at the 37-floor building on the northeast corner of 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, overlooking Central Park. (Getting a room overlooking the park is another matter.) What largely gives the recently renovated hotel its personality and, perhaps, its appeal, is that the majority of its rooms are co-op apartments for permanent residents. This gives the Sherry-Netherland its unhurried, private, low-key style, which may -- or may not -- be suitable for tourists on the run or business executives who need round-the-clock coffee and fax machines.

The number of clubs depends on the environment for jazz; the signs suggest this is a fertile era.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940415","headline":"Last Chance","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/theater/last-chance.html","abstract":"  Here is a sampling of shows and exhibitions in New York City that are to close soon: Closing This Weekend  \"WRITTEN AND SEALED,\" Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton.

That is what makes the behavior of City Hall's chief negotiator, Deputy Mayor John Dyson, so regrettable. He sounds more like an agent for Mortimer Zuckerman, the developer, than a public servant.   Even if Mr. Dyson is motivated only by his zeal to encourage development, and not by any desire to reward a political ally, he has so mishandled the negotiations that they are tainted. How could Mr. Dyson propose that the city -- through hidden tax abatements and backdoor capital budget maneuvers -- subsidize a real estate developer at a time when the Mayor is demanding sacrifice from nearly every city agency and worker?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940415","headline":"Inflation: Myth and Reality","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/opinion/inflation-myth-and-reality.html","abstract":"  Fears of accelerating inflation have haunted the financial markets just at the time when the economy has turned in its best inflation performance in decades.

He always conjured up visions of purity, line, grace and beauty.\n\n He also shared his talent unselfishly. While he made his name in solo figure skating, he was willing to exhaust all the abilities he had: his professional projects included efforts in pairs skating and ice dancing, always bringing innovation and freshness to the ice. And as great as he was, he was always encouraging, making his skating partners fell equally talented and special.\n\n Curry crossed the boundaries of sport and was recognized by the dance world. His collaboration with choreographers such as Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Twyla Tharp, Lar Lubovitch, Laura Dean and Peter Martins underscored his versatility.\n\n Some artists are encumbered by the restrictions inherent in their field. Because Curry let nothing stand in his way, his limits were never defined.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940416","headline":"Public & Private; Poetry Emotion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/16/opinion/public-private-poetry-emotion.html","abstract":"  Yusef Komunyakaa won the Pulitzer Prize this week, but he does not expect to become a household name, and not because his name itself, phonetically simple once parsed out bit by bit, looks at first glance so unpronounceable.

He always conjured up visions of purity, line, grace and beauty.\n\n He also shared his talent unselfishly. While he made his name in solo figure skating, he was willing to exhaust all the abilities he had: his professional projects included efforts in pairs skating and ice dancing, always bringing innovation and freshness to the ice. And as great as he was, he was always encouraging, making his skating partners fell equally talented and special.\n\n Curry crossed the boundaries of sport and was recognized by the dance world. His collaboration with choreographers such as Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Twyla Tharp, Lar Lubovitch, Laura Dean and Peter Martins underscored his versatility.\n\n Some artists are encumbered by the restrictions inherent in their field. Because Curry let nothing stand in his way, his limits were never defined.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940416","headline":"Most Programs for Dyslexic Children Succeed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/16/opinion/l-most-programs-for-dyslexic-children-succeed-807281.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I respond to \"A Disabilities Program That 'Got Out of Hand,' \" your April 8 front-page article about the Fisher Landau program for dyslexic children at the Dalton School in New York City, as a learning specialist, a member of the Fisher Landau advisory board, and as a member of the Orton Dyslexia Society (New York branch and national).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940416","headline":"Carlo Bergonzi Will Define 'Retirement' as He Wishes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/16/arts/carlo-bergonzi-will-define-retirement-as-he-wishes.html","abstract":"  Retirement for an opera singer means an end to instant recognition, stage-door groupies, recording projects, the pleasure of filling a theater with one's voice and the thrill of standing center stage and receiving cheers from packed houses.

Medea is not a woman to be easily characterized. \"I am adept at everything that's hidden,\" she boasts to the women of Corinth. She then goes on to commit atrocities that astonish even her. To play her mostly as victim is to humble one of world literature's most titanic creations.    Yet even if the initial concept of the production is wrongheaded, the Euripides \"Medea\" now in a limited engagement at the Longacre Theater is efficient, polished and high-toned. It's also a theatrical event, marking the return to Broadway of Diana Rigg, who plays the title role, her first appearance in New York since 1975 and her bewitching performance as Celimene in \"The Misanthrope.\" Further, this \"Medea,\" directed by Jonathan Kent, is fashionably contemporary in its theatrical effects and in Alistair Elliot's new translation.

The great popular dissemination of art books and classical records in postwar America did not demean art and music, but created larger audiences for them. The CD-ROM disk speaks to the masses of children who are already interactive computer literati and opens up a world for them that is different from the Super Mario game world to which most of them are already addicted. The most highly motivated children will want to go to the National Gallery after using the CD-ROM anyway. They can use the disk to do papers in high school and college.

Born in Italy in 1896, Modotti emigrated in 1913 to the United States, where her natural beauty led to modeling jobs and roles in silent films. In Los Angeles she met Edward Weston, who documented her allure in some of his best-known photographs. They became lovers and traveled to Mexico together in 1923, where Modotti served as Weston's apprentice. Within a year, he returned to the States, leaving Modotti to run his studio; her career as a professional photographer soon took off. Poverty in Mexico affected her profoundly, and she began using her art to protest social injustice. She became a member of the Mexican Communist Party, and in 1930 she was deported. From then on, living in Berlin, Moscow, Paris or Spain (during its civil war), she more or less gave up taking pictures; her life revolved around radical politics. Offered the position of official photographer of the Soviet Communist Party, she turned it down. \"While she was too devoted to the party to risk disapproval or expulsion,\" Ms. Hooks writes, \"Tina was too much of an artist to see her work reduced to mere propaganda.\" Modotti's output comprises a scant 400 photographs, about 100 of which are reproduced in this book. They speak eloquently of her gift, revealing a true artistic eye and a formalist's sense of composition. Modotti died in Mexico City in 1942 at the age of 45, but she lives on through her art; her photograph \"Roses\" sold for $165,000 at Sotheby's in 1991.
