The reason was that she used to sew men's topcoats, not men's shirts or women's nightgowns.    Under the current patchwork of government programs to help workers permanently put out of jobs, the reason a worker has lost a job -- imports, military cuts, the spotted owl -- has to be the right one. The wrong one can mean that older workers whose job skills are no longer in demand are not eligible for much more than 26 weeks of unemployment checks and a bit of counseling.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930902","headline":"Timber Country Sees a Vacation Land","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/02/us/timber-country-sees-a-vacation-land.html","abstract":"  When Senator Patty Murray ventured into the heart of timber country here today, she expected something less than the customary courtesy given legislators on home-state tours.

The darkness, of course, exists only for the people onstage, since everything that happens after the electricity has gone, in the world of the play, is performed in a blaze of stage lights amid John Lee Beatty's vibrant Pop/Op setting.   Since its New York debut in 1967, with a cast that included Michael Crawford, Lynn Redgrave and Geraldine Page, \"Black Comedy\" has had a healthy life in American community and university theaters, and one can see why. It is, for its first half-hour, almost foolproof comically. It not only offers a novel occasion for the eternal gymnastics of elemental farce: people falling down stairs, bumping into doors and furniture and mistakenly groping each other. It also, in showing twittish characters trying to maintain their customary social rituals in a world deprived of visual cues, coaxes the latent absurdity out of those rituals, and even the process of mixing a cocktail courts burlesque disaster.

It may not have looked like the beginning of a monthlong series devoted to the work of a major composer, but that's exactly what it was. On Wednesday night, the Knitting Factory started what might be called its Zorniad, marking Mr. Zorn's 40th year. The Knitting Factory is the appropriate place for the project, since Mr. Zorn has performed there regularly and collaborated with a good percentage of the club's other headliners.   The retrospective began with juvenilia. \"Caevorrys,\" written when the composer was 12 years old, received what Mr. Zorn called its \"first and probably last public performance.\" \"Caevorrys\" (for clarinet, flute, piano and \"frequency generator,\" now a synthesizer) presaged later work. Mr. Zorn likes texture, noise, sudden changes and raucousness; he doesn't have much use for melody or smooth transitions. He has cited the contemporary classical composer Mauricio Kagel and the free-jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler as influences; both modern musics encouraged his own love of cacophony and crunch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"1918: Biting Hindenburg : IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/opinion/IHT-1918-biting-hindenburg-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - Canadian and English troops, attacking just before dawn yesterday [Sept. 2], behind a monster array of tanks, have bitten deeply into the Quéant-Drocourt line, a switch of the Hindenburg line, and dealt the German a staggering blow at one of","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Review/Film; Life and Death at the Edge: The Story of a Drag Queen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/movies/review-film-life-and-death-at-the-edge-the-story-of-a-drag-queen.html","abstract":"  International Chrysis, the Bronx-born drag queen who is the subject of the documentary film \"Split,\" had long red hair, a ferociously engaging smile and oversized breasts that she liked to show off in New York City nightspots like La Vie en Rose and Club 82.

He claimed Saturn as his birthplace and filled his lyrics with interstellar imagery. Unlike most jazz films, \"Space Is the Place,\" which opens today at the Walter Reade Theater, doesn't bother with the composer's biography, although it does offer glimpses of Ra's Intergalactic Myth-Science Solar Arkestra. Most of the time, however, it proffers fantasies to match the hallucinatory music. Made in 1974, it's already an artifact of a time when the hangover of the late 1960's met the disillusioned 1970's; black power and free jazz collided with the fashion sense of Superfly. \"Space Is the Place\" is the \"Putney Swope\" of jazz films.   In the movie's episodic plot, Sun Ra -- dressed in full glitter-Egyptian regalia -- lives on a bluish planet populated entirely by black people. He comes to Earth, in a spaceship that looks like a pair of bloodshot eyeballs painted on a rubber raft, to recruit more black colonists and to philosophize. \"Are you ready to alter your destiny?\" he asks.   On Earth, Ra has run-ins with two black opponents, an obeisant newscaster and the diabolical Mr. Overseer, and two white Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. There's a vignette in a mid-1940's jazz club in Chicago (where Ra's piano-playing is too avant-garde for the management), a cosmic card game and some proselytizing at an inner-city youth center, where one teen-ager dismisses Ra as \"some old hippie.\" \"How do we know you're for real?\" another asks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Police Identify 13th Body As Victim of L.I.

Dinkins begins broadcasting two new 30-second television commercials, in addition to the three ads already on the air. One of the new ads features city-built ballfields in vacant lots, the other expanded library service. The campaign says its ad buy for the week is $305,000, enough for a typical viewer to see a Dinkins ad 8 or 10 times in that period.   ON THE SCREEN Images of David Meadvin, 9-year-old campaign voluteer walking to East Elmhurst public library branch in Queens, using computer card catalogue, pulling book off shelf, sitting at table perusing book with Mr. Dinkins and walking down aisle. Ends with facsimile of Mayor's signature on screen with silent slogan: \"One City. One Future.\"   PRODUCER Doak, Shrum, Harris, Carrier, Devine of Washington.   THE SCRIPT Narrator's voice: When David Meadvin goes to the library, he opens more than a book. He opens doors to the future. There was another young man who long ago learned lessons like that in his own life. And today, as Mayor of New York, in the face of Federal cutbacks and budget crisis, he's fought to open city libraries six days a week, for the first time in almost half a century. Because of David Dinkins, libraries are about more than buildings and books. They're about New York's children and what they someday can become. Mayor Dinkins. It takes more than tough talk to run a tough city.   ACCURACY Mr. Dinkins has moved to extend branch library service in all five boroughs to six days a week for the first time since 1947, but only after first making deep and bitterly protested cuts in library hours and services in his first 18 months in office to help balance the budget.   SCORECARD This ad, with its soothing soundtrack and soft, sentimental images of an avuncular Mayor, is part of a pointillist campaign that aims to blend dozens of dots into a persuasive pictures, and it does several chores at once. It highlights a small but important accomplishment that the Mayor has managed to make in tough times, one that hits many New Yorkers in their own neighborhoods. It plays to the Mayor's natural warmth and affection for children, which virtually leaps off the screen. It invokes the Mayor's place in history, both by recalling Mr. Dinkins's own diligent rise (he often notes that he was a B student in Latin at his segregated junior high school in Trenton, then led the class at his integrated high school) and his place as a potentially powerful role model for a new generation of children.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"TV Listings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/us/tv-listings.html","abstract":"  On Fridays, television and radio news and listings now appear at the end of section D, with Home Video.

Yet that very success created high expectations that, both supporters and critics agree, Mr. Dinkins has been hard-pressed to fulfill.   The defection of Fire Commissioner Carlos M. Rivera to the Giuliani camp on Tuesday was the latest in a series of bitter blows to a Mayor who had hoped to win credit for making history by naming Mr. Rivera the first Hispanic head of a uniformed service. Instead, he has struggled for most of his tenure to hold onto Hispanic supporters who have steadily drifted toward Mr. Giuliani.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Once Again, Boxing World Is Hiding Behind Sunglasses","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/sports/boxing-once-again-boxing-world-is-hiding-behind-sunglasses.html","abstract":"  As usual, boxing has demonstrated its ability to give itself a black eye.

In 1963, in a gesture of good will, the French lent Leonardo Da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" to the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the next year the Italians sent Michelangelo's \"Pieta\" to town on the occasion of the World's Fair.   Now there's a third visitor that, while not nearly so legendary, deserves to be on this very short list: Andrea del Verrocchio's bronze \"Christ and St. Thomas,\" now at the Metropolitan Museum. The statue was unveiled in Florence in 1483, 15 years after it was commissioned by Lorenzo de' Medici for an exterior niche of Orsanmichele. More than life-size and fresh from five years of conservation work that has restored much of its original patina and many previously obscured details, Verrocchio's sculpture is a technical feat of casting. (If you're interested, the exhibition includes models that illustrate the intricacies of the lost-wax casting process.) More than that, of course, it is one of the high points of the Renaissance drive toward naturalism and emotional truth that would culminate in the art of Verrocchio's student Leonardo, whose own brilliance tended to overshadow his master's. Verrocchio's brilliance is splendidly evident in this astounding work, which Vasari saw as having \"all the grace and divinity that art can convey.\" Do not miss it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Law Helps Communities Evict Bad Neighbors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/opinion/l-law-helps-communities-evict-bad-neighbors-224993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As a Civil Court judge assigned to the \"drug eviction part,\" I write regarding an Aug. 22 article on efforts by a Bronx church to close alleged drug premises.

This show places before the viewer nearly 40 Minimalist or proto-Minimalist paintings from the 1950's, 60's and 70's, most of them from the museum's collection. Dominated by canvases in muted shades of gray, olive, blue and white or intractable black, it is nothing if not quiet and serene.   Although somewhat flawed in conception and limited in breadth, \"Singular Dimensions\" offers one of the most extensive surveys of this style in several years. By concentrating on painting instead of sculpture, it emphasizes Minimalism's gentler side, countering the tendency among feminist art historians to see it rather simplistically as a uniformly authoritarian, macho way of art making.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Subway Explosion in Bronx Injures Four","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/nyregion/subway-explosion-in-bronx-injures-four.html","abstract":"  An explosion underneath a subway train in the Bronx yesterday injured four people and delayed trains for two hours, a spokesman for the Transit Authority said.

The team was also cited for failing to notify the league of the allegations. The league's inquiry was prompted by reports that Bruce Firestone, former chairman and co-owner of the Senators, had offered inducements to players to lose their final game against the Boston Bruins so Ottawa would be assured the first pick in last June's entry draft. Although there was some dispute as to what exactly was said, Firestone acknowledged that certain intemperate and inappropriate comments were made regarding the club's performance last season, the league said. But Commissioner Gary Bettman said, \"There was no basis in fact to those comments.\" (AP) COLLEGE FOOTBALL Two Winning Debuts It was a winning start for two coaches in new assignments last night.

This revue, created by and starring Bill Irwin and David Shiner, is a far more effective safety valve for urban pressures than drinking two martinis or yelling at a runaway taxi driver. Even before the curtain goes up, Mr. Irwin and Mr. Shiner give us a taste of exactly what can go wrong in a typical night at the theater: Mr. Shiner, by impersonating an obstreperous late arrival who can't find his seat, and Mr. Irwin, by portraying a would-be emcee vanquished by a recalcitrant microphone wire before he can speak a word. Frustration, it becomes clear, is what this production is really about.   For the rest of the performance, with the gleefully eclectic musical accompaniment of the Red Clay Ramblers, Mr. Irwin and Mr. Shiner -- who play off each other in a good-clown, bad-clown tandem -- sustain a highly cathartic interpretation of life as an eternal wrestling match. Car doors, plates of spaghetti, cigarettes and even the performers' own intractable limbs are autonomous forces with daunting powers of their own.

The restaurant reopened with a new owner about two weeks ago, and at this early date, it appears that what was a menu of French food caught in a time warp has been refreshed and reinvigorated without losing its classic roots.   The new chef, Matthew Tivy, 32, whose recent experience has been mostly in brash contemporary restaurants in lower Manhattan, appears to be filling his larder with fine raw materials for French cooking with some inventive grace notes. Among the appetizers ($5.50 to $18.50), a salad of tender warm skate, set on a bed of frisee and perfumed with basil ($8.50), had slivers of jicama for texture. Escargots suitably bolstered with ample garlic were tossed with cream and toasted pine nuts over angel hair pasta ($10.50), and the smooth spinach soup ($6) matched the delicacy of the oysters afloat in it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Don James Finds That Roses Outnumber the Thorns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/sports/college-football-don-james-finds-that-roses-outnumber-the-thorns.html","abstract":"  The former coach will arrive by yacht.

The cafe, three months old, has overcome its initial confusion. It is now turning out a marvelous array of mostly seafood dishes, with Thai and Southwestern touches, at prices that, if not exactly at sea level, don't wander too far up the mizzenmast. Aside from the menu, there's not a whole lot to distinguish the new cafe from the larger restaurant, now restricted to the back room and separated from the front by a long, burnished bar. They share the same entrance, the same kitchen headed by Gary Robbins and overseen by Alfred Portale, the same staff and the same phone number, making it incumbent upon the diner to specify the cafe when calling for a reservation or walking in off the street. They even share the same decor, walls of aqua, gray and white rectangular panels back-lighted to give the feel of a set for a 1950's television talk show, although Dave Garroway and the chimp are missing. The only other difference I could detect in the cafe was the fabric covers with Picassoesque designs slipped over the back of the plain but comfortable chairs. Despite the new sense of energy in the front room, the clientele is basically buttoned down and quiet, competing with the background music of light rock rather than with one another to be heard.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930903","time":"1993-09-03

But the health risks posed by a few days, or even months, of attendance in schools with asbestos where the exposure could be limited are negligible, they said -- less than the statistical likelihood of developing AIDS or being killed by a mugger, a drunken driver or a bolt of lightning.

Mr. Childs, a young pianist who lives in Los Angeles, has caught a few breaks on the way: he's recording for Windham Hill and is in the middle of a week working at perhaps the most respected jazz club in the world. He may have been pushed into view a bit early in his career. Mr. Childs can improvise and swing, but his conception never quite seemed authoritative.   It's strange listening to a musician not based in New York. While the best of the young pianists from New York -- Cyrus Chestnut, Stephen Scott, Jacky Terrasson -- have all delved deep into history, Mr. Childs's improvisations were modern in an old-fashioned way, his references predictable. The overt borrowings of the New York school, with its elements of stride, Thelonious Monk, gospel and the 1960's modernists, makes its players unsentimental and rich in narrative; Mr. Childs used one or two colors for most of his show, never really setting up drama.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"Dinkins Agrees to 2 Debates With Democratic Rivals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/04/nyregion/dinkins-agrees-to-2-debates-with-democratic-rivals.html","abstract":"  Mayor David N.

No match was found, and JoAnne died.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"Olympus Drops Plan for New Headquarters in Melville","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/04/nyregion/olympus-drops-plan-for-new-headquarters-in-melville.html","abstract":"  The Olympus Corporation, the Japanese-owned manufacturer of cameras and medical equipment, has dropped plans to build a new American corporate headquarters on 53.7 acres of state land in Melville, L.I., citing legal opposition from a local civic association.   The decision, conveyed to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in a letter today from Kenji Fujii, the president and chief executive officer of Olympus America of Lake Success, marks the collapse of a two-year effort by the State Urban Development Corporation and Suffolk County to assist the company in siting the headquarters on a corner of the 500-acre Long Island Developmental Center, a former state center for the retarded.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"After Pullout, Lithuania Faces Other Challenges","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/04/world/after-pullout-lithuania-faces-other-challenges.html","abstract":"  Only hours after the last unit of Russian soldiers left Lithuania on Tuesday night, jubilant Government officials began giving their friends new stickers they had privately printed. The stickers carry the national coat of arms and the legend: \"Lithuania, Free of Foreign Troops.\"   The nation breathed a collective sigh of relief when the long train laden with Russian soldiers and weapons finally left Lithuanian soil. People here had been praying for this moment for more than half a century, many without believing it would ever come.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"E.M.S.

The 40-year-old woman, Nancy Vitale, was left without treatment for nearly three hours after the two technicians decided she was dead. It was not until a doctor from the city Medical Examiner's office heard gurgling sounds coming from Ms. Vitale that she was taken to Coney Island Hospital, where she was treated and eventually released.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"Billups Draws One Year in Prison","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/04/sports/sports-people-football-billups-draws-one-year-in-prison.html","abstract":"  Former Cincinnati Bengals player LEWIS BILLUPS was sentenced to 12 months in prison and fined $10,000 yesterday for threatening the Washington Bullets' REX CHAPMAN in calls to Chapman's sister.   Billups pleaded guilty in June to making phone calls from Florida to his former girlfriend, JENNY CHAPMAN, in which he threatened to ruin Rex Chapman's career if she talked to another man. In one call, Billups threatened to have friends break the player's knees.

While some of his good friends have been shown the door, good friends like linebacker Pepper Johnson, Taylor had been pretty silent. Until today.   Taylor said that while he disagreed with some of the personnel changes made by Coach Dan Reeves -- changes like waiving Johnson, who was later picked up by the Cleveland Browns -- he realized that the team has to move on. Still, it became apparent that Taylor missed Johnson and didn't like the decision to release him.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"Supposed to Be Rude?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/04/opinion/l-supposed-to-be-rude-474393.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   My wife and I took our 15-year-old grandson, Kurt, to New York City over the weekend to show him the usual sites.
