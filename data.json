Its exact borders are frequently debated, but generally it includes art made by patients in mental hospitals, by recluses, naives and visionaries, by rural laborers saying they receive instructions from God, by suddenly creative retirees. In the near future, it may come to include art made by people in prisons. It has its share of true geniuses, like Adolf Wolfli, Martin Ramirez, Henry Darger and Bill Traylor. It has its own history, which stretches back to the late 19th century and regularly intersects with the development of modern art. In addition, as one of the fastest-growing areas of the art world in terms of interest, knowledge and (of course) marketing, outsider art also has its own fledgling art fair.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940128","headline":"With Words Alone : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/28/opinion/IHT-with-words-alone-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is deluding itself if it thinks that by refusing membership to Central European states it decreases Vladimir Zhirinovsky's chances in the next Russian elections.

A few moments later, the English horn enters with another melody, Arnalta's lullaby from Monteverdi's \"Incoronazione di Poppea,\" which bears an uncanny resemblance to the Schuman. The lullaby is almost jarringly sweet and comforting, hovering in sonic space as the percussion creates a quivering, otherworldly haze.   It is a remarkable moment in a strongly conceived elegy, a composition that, like many of Mr. Rouse's other works, is preoccupied with death and loss. The composer's Trombone Concerto, which was given its world premiere by the New York Philharmonic last year (and which won the Pulitzer Prize), was written in memory of Leonard Bernstein and quotes Bernstein's \"Kaddish\" Symphony. The new work was commissioned by Betty Freeman for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Yo-Yo Ma (who was the soloist in its first performance with the orchestra, conducted by David Zinman); it is partly a response to the deaths of the composers Andrzej Panufnik and Stephen Albert as well as Schuman, and quotes from them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940128","headline":"Guns Gaining on Cars as a Leading U.S. Killer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/28/us/guns-gaining-on-cars-as-a-leading-us-killer.html","abstract":"  If current trends continue, gunshot wounds will take more lives nationwide than automobile accidents by 2003 -- a point already reached in the District of Columbia and six states, including New York, according to a report released today by the Department of Health and Human Services.   \"It is appalling that in the world's strongest and wealthiest country, death by firearms is increasing at the alarming rate these studies find,\" Health Secretary Donna E.

A few years later, the fad has crested, but some bands still think the style has possibilities. Two of them, Swervedriver (from Oxford, England) and Medicine (from the San Fernando Valley in California) performed on Thursday night at Irving Plaza.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940129","headline":"DIALOGUE: 'Three Strikes' -- Two Views;\nWrong Way To Get Tough","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/29/opinion/dialogue-three-strikes-two-views-wrong-way-to-get-tough.html","abstract":"At 10 years old, Albert had already distinguished himself as the youngest member of his barrio gang.

Indeed, the Justice Department seems to be the most disorganized agency in an Administration not exactly known for precision management.    The abrupt resignation of Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann after only nine months is another setback. Mr. Heymann, a respected legal educator and seasoned criminal law administrator, was challenged to end the department's headless drift. Now faulty \"chemistry\" requires his departure and reopens holes in top management. Coherent leadership still seems far in the future. Ms. Reno's supporters say she found him too dilatory.

It's still cold and still half-French: Ottawa is one of the world's most northerly capitals, and its citizens make bilingualism sound impressively effortless. But the \"difficult to stir\" part is being re-evaluated, because the formerly stodgy city looks increasingly lively.\n\nIt has always been picturesque, particularly in winter. When the Rideau Canal freezes (at about 4.5 miles, it's billed as \"the world's longest skating rink\"), Ottawa looks like a Ruritanian dream capital, peopled by happy bureaucrats skating their way to work in neo-Gothic Parliament buildings. To the north, on Nepean Point, the glassy National Gallery shines like a gigantic ice sculpture. But even skating civil servants cannot subsist on mere charm, and every year they find more diversions, better restaurants, more sophisticated shopping in Ottawa. One of those diversions, Winterlude (more poetically called Bal de Neige, or Snow Ball, in French) has been providing cold-weather denial or festivity, depending on how you look at it, since 1979. Winterlude this year comes with a coda -- an extra weekend (Feb. 18 to 20) after the festival's normal 10-day span (Feb. 4 to 13). The posters enjoin, \"Don't Hibernate, Come Celebrate,\" and last year 400,000 visitors complied, taking part in more than 100 activities spread over seven sites in Ottawa and across the Ottawa River in the province of Quebec.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"Alden Jones, Richard Perkins 3d","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/style/weddings-alden-jones-richard-perkins-3d.html","abstract":"  Alden Landry Jones, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Graham E.

They will read from copies of \"Ulysses,\" listen to music composed by Joyce, hear his voice on recordings, join impromptu discussions of the man and his work, watch screenings of three Joycean films and consume copious amounts of Irish soda bread and tea.   The films are: \"The Dead,\" based on Joyce's short story, directed by John Huston and starring Anjelica Huston, to be shown at 11 A.M.; \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\" screened at 2 P.M. with John Gielgud in a fiery bit as Joyce's priest, and \"James Joyce's Women,\" with Fionnula Flanagan portraying the key women in Joyce's life at 7 P.M.

Both stars died in their 30's; both were rumored to have been murdered (he by poison from a romantic rival, she by a drug overdose administered by various conspirators); both were wildly worshiped (fans' suicides followed his death; an outpouring of obsessive writing continues to follow hers), and both, decades after their deaths, suggested the possibility of grand opera to skillful composers who stumbled badly along the way.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"Canucks Overpower Devils","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/sports/hockey-canucks-overpower-devils.html","abstract":"  Too many factors were working against the Devils in their game against the Vancouver Canucks last night and, in the end, they proved too much to overcome as New Jersey lost, 6-3.

After a mediocre regular season, in which he threw 18 interceptions, Kelly has had two strong performances in the playoffs. Troy Aikman threw just six interceptions this season. He left last week's game with a concussion. But if he is 100 percent, he is more dangerous than his counterpart. Edge: Cowboys.   RUNNING BACKS Emmitt Smith has won three straight rushing titles, but has been slowed recently by a separated shoulder. Thurman Thomas rushed for 186 yards in the A.F.C. championship game. Edge: Bills.   RECEIVERS The Bills' Billy Brooks, Andre Reed and Don Beebe do not match the explosiveness of Dallas's Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper. Edge: Cowboys.   OFFENSIVE LINE Two big, powerful groups that like crushing opposing defensive fronts. The Cowboys averaged 135.1 yards per game rushing in the regular season, and the Bills averaged 121.4 yards a game. The Cowboys' line, in particular, has provided Aikman with excellent protection. assing and just six interceptions thrown. Edge: Cowboys.   DEFENSIVE LINE Bills defensive end Bruce Smith had a strong season, with 14 sacks and 24 quarterback pressures. But his greatness has become expected, so what he did went relatively unnoticed. Cowboys defensive end Charles Haley has a bad back and if he plays, he will be limited. The Cowboys are very quick and strong and come with a ton of pressure. Edge: Bills.   LINEBACKERS Marvcus Patton and Mark Maddox have given the Bills some aggressiveness and hard hitting in the middle. Add Cornelius Bennett and Darryl Talley on the outside and you have trouble. Dallas middle linebacker Ken Norton has played much of the season with a torn bicep. Edge: Bills.   SECONDARY Cornerback Kevin Smith, whose six interceptions were the second highest in the N.F.C., and safety Thomas Everett give the Dallas unit the bite to back up their bark. Bills safety Henry Jones is a versatile player who could draw some responsibility for trying to stop Emmitt Smith. Edge: Cowboys.   SPECIAL TEAMS Buffalo's Danny Copeland is a tough kick returner who has run back a punt for a touchdown this year. And Steve Tasker is a perennial All-Pro. Dallas's Kevin Williams is a dangerous performer who returned two punts for touchdowns this year. Playing in the Georgia Dome should not have a bearing on the field-goal attempts by Buffalo's Steve Christie or Dallas's Eddie Murray. Edge: Cowboys.   COACHES Marv Levy has overcome three previous Super Bowl losses to get his team in a position for one more shot. Unfortunately, on Super Bowl Day, there is always a short-circuit with the Bills' game plan. Dallas's Jimmy Johnson excels at having his team mentally and physically prepared for big games. And in football there are none bigger than the Super Bowl. Edge: Cowboys.   OVER ALL If the Bills can stay away from turnovers, they have a shot to stay close. The Bills bring an awful lot of baggage to this game, and it will be hard for them to unload it unless they have a big lead going into the fourth quarter. That probably won't happen.

But the \"difficult to stir\" part is being re-evaluated, because the formerly stodgy city looks increasingly lively.\n\nIt has always been picturesque, particularly in winter.

As if it were a show that had been put together by the man considered to be the greatest producer in Broadway's history, what appears at first blush to be just another coffeetable extravaganza proves far more substantial than its opulent illustrations and lavish packaging might suggest. Richard and Paulette Ziegfeld persuasively argue that Ziegfeld was more than just an extravagant showman; he was also an artist who \"raised the revue form progressively from burlesque to vaudeville to art.\" Ziegfeld began his legendary career in 1893 by promoting Sandow, a circus strongman, in his native Chicago. Within a few years Ziegfeld had settled in New York, where he produced more than 80 shows before his death in 1932 at the age of 65. From the start, the authors write, his shows flirted with \"the bounds of propriety\" and \"prompted talk about vulgarity,\" but in the end \"his ability to meld the best of both high and low cultures\" had permanently shaped the course of the American theater. In addition to \"The Ziegfeld Follies,\" his annual signature offering, Ziegfeld produced a wide variety of plays and musical diversions, often showcasing his many mistresses or his long-suffering second wife, Billie Burke. In the same way that Ziegfeld provided more than simply the titillation his works were famous for, the authors' early peekaboo treatment of Ziegfeld's notorious womanizing and gambling gives way to a deeperanalysis of what such behavior entailed. The book has many revealing anecdotes, and a veritable who's who of the American theater parades through these pages just as it paraded through Ziegfeld's life.

On Thursday, three days after a Federal deadline, the city said it had probably found a temporary site for the 60 trucks: a warehouse on 30th Street near 12th Avenue. Community Board 4 in midtown west is not thrilled with the idea of more trucks moving through the neighborhood in order to serve the East Side.

If he made it, we probably would have won.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"In New Haven, Taking Action Against AIDS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/nyregion/in-new-haven-taking-action-against-aids.html","abstract":"  THE other evening in New Haven, George Bucheli and Phil Haskell were driving down a dark stretch of road near the Long Wharf section of the city. They pulled into a parking lot and spotted a young man sitting in a red Toyota sedan. \"He's alone,\" Mr. Bucheli said. \"Let's get him.\"   After he pulled up to the curb, Mr. Haskell grabbed a plastic bag full of condoms from a box in the front seat and slid out of the car. Clutching the condoms under his arm he walked over to the red sedan, knocked on the window and offered them to the man. The man accepted them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"Animal House Calls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/nyregion/making-it-work-animal-house-calls.html","abstract":"  HAULING a medical kit about the size of a truck mechanic's toolbox, Dr. Bonnie L. Raphael recently trudged out to a waiting van, which then carried her over winding, snow-packed roads on a house call in a semirural expanse of the Bronx. At the end of the slippery trek through frozen downsized range lands and past a few Africanesque huts, the doctor finally stood toe to toe with her patient: a gray-feathered crane with a wounded wing.   Replacing her winter gloves with rubber ones, she carefully went to work, as she has for much of her adult life, attending to the medical needs of an animal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New
