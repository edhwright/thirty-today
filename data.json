Those who had encountered the group through recordings on various English labels were not surprised by the wide-ranging, well-judged program: large sacred pieces by John Sheppard, Richard Hygons and Thomas Tallis, together with shorter settings and carols appropriate to the Christmas season.    Although its repertory ranges well into the 20th century, the Sixteen, conducted by Harry Christophers, has done perhaps its most important work in behalf of English composers of the Tudor period. Picking up from the pioneering work of David Wulstan, Mr. Christophers has greatly expanded our knowledge of John Sheppard, resident composer at Magdalen College in Oxford in the second half of the 16th century. Sheppard was represented on Sunday's program by \"A solis ortus cardine\" and \"Verbum caro factum est,\" each a small masterpiece of stately, intricate polyphony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931214","headline":"1893: Minister Gored : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/14/opinion/IHT-1893-minister-gored-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"NEW YORK - The Herald's correspondent at Lima states that the British Minister, Colonel Sir Charles Mansfield, was attacked while returning from a cricket match, by a furious cow, which gored him.

But most people who marry hope and expect children to be born to them. We are willing to expend enormous amounts of love and attention and care as well as money to raise capable and healthy offspring. Surely, giving some thought to their genetic load is not misplaced (\"Nightmare or the Dream of a New Era in Genetics?\", front page, Dec. 7).   Dor Yeshorim, an Orthodox Jewish program using advanced molecular technology to screen young people considering marriage, was formed to enhance the effort to have healthy children by sparing potential partners the agony of conceiving genetically defective children. With increased medical research, there are many more conditions that can be prevented than Tay-Sachs disease.   While ethicists agonize over some people's being marginalized as marriage partners, they would do better to focus on the fact that medical conditions not manifesting themselves until middle age do not make them benign or pleasant to live with.   Very few of us are interested in spending much effort to maintain good health. Rather, good health is seen as a birthright. And while it is true there are many common conditions that do not compromise actual life, they do not enhance it either and many sufferers would prefer a less flawed genetic endowment.   Dor Yeshorim's purpose is to allow potential marriage partners to establish in advance of emotional involvement whether or not a relationship should be pursued. For those with multiple problems, presumably a pool of potential partners can be identified with whom normal children can be produced. Prevention beats remediation any day.

In this drama of a Ukrainian family's struggle to survive a Government-created famine that killed more than seven million (a quarter of the population) in 1933, the suffering is etched in the stony faces of people too weary and weak to raise their voices.   In an early scene, the members of an impoverished farming family solemnly take turns dipping their ladles into the single bowl of watery soup that is their only meal of the day. Later in the film, scores of villagers numb with despair and hunger huddle silently in the pouring rain outside a Government office until a truckload of armed soldiers arrives to disperse them. In the most poignant scene, a little boy who has lost his parents calls for his mother as he wanders panic-stricken through a snowy woodland where the trees are outnumbered by crosses marking the dead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931215","headline":"A Condom for Women Is Winning Favor; Among Women First to Use It as a Shield Against H.I.V., the Device Gains Interest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/15/nyregion/condom-for-women-winning-favor-among-women-first-use-it-shield-against-hiv.html","abstract":"  Despite the jokes, warnings and lukewarm endorsements that greeted its approval by the Government, the condom for women is quietly gaining interest and often acceptance among the women who have been the first to try it in the United States as a weapon against H.I.V.

Indeed, it is the unevenness of \"L'Enfance du Christ,\" which Roger Norrington, the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus brought to Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday, that creates much of its charm. Part 1, given over to King Herod's anxious dreams and the Slaughter of the Innocents, is opera pure and simple. In the first of many pictorial strokes, Roman sentinels pace to bass pizzicatos.

Symphonists before and after him wrote works that might be the centerpieces of concert programs but that nevertheless must share the spotlight. With a couple of exceptions -- the First and Fourth Symphonies -- Mahler's symphonies are so expansive as to require evenings to themselves. It's a good thing, because these works are as emotionally draining as they are long, and they require an involvement that would render the side dishes on the traditional concert menu irrelevant, even irritating.   What Mahler painted on these vast sonic canvases are visions of mortality and the vain struggle to defeat it. These are not visions of heaven (although in the finale of the Fourth, Mahler suggests one view of it), but of life and death in the here and now, with extremes of elation and despair transformed into musical topography. It is music that lends itself to peculiar exegeses: read enough Mahler essays and you encounter theories, advanced seriously, suggesting that Mahler's symphonies embody predictions of both world wars, racial strife and other calamities that have befallen the world since Mahler's death in 1911. It is as if the music's tragic scope is too great to be merely autobiographical.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931216","headline":"CLINTON REAFFIRMS POLICY ON YELTSIN","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/16/world/clinton-reaffirms-policy-on-yeltsin.html","abstract":"  President Clinton today played down the importance of the unexpectedly strong showing of anti-reformers in the Russian elections and said there was no need to change Washington's policy toward Moscow.

Sepultura is from Brazil, and now and then the band showed its roots with tapes of traditional drumming and a few syncopated drum licks. But most of the music wholeheartedly embraced its genre. The lyrics are in English, terse and slightly stilted, though no more awkward than words by speed-metal bands from English-speaking countries: \"Army in siege/ Total alarm/I'm sick of this,\" Max Cavalera growled in \"Refuse/Resist\" from the band's new album \"Chaos A.D.\" (Roadrunner/Epic).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931216","headline":"For Drink or Drugs, Prohibition Doesn't Work; Pot and Chemotherapy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/16/opinion/l-for-drink-or-drugs-prohibition-doesn-t-work-pot-and-chemotherapy-774593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The next time Dr. Gabriel Nahas and Dr. Nicholas Pace attack marijuana as a way of controlling nausea in chemotherapy, they should check with their colleagues at New York University Medical Center (letter, Dec. 4).

The map should sharply accelerate scientists' efforts to isolate the 100,000 genes that make up human DNA, to track down mutations that result in disease, to trace the evolution of humanity as recorded by subtle runes inscribed in the genes and to solve other grand puzzles of biology. Those efforts are all part of the Human Genome Project, a 15-year program now under way at dozens of laboratories in the United States and abroad. Flaws Are Conceded    The new map, called a physical map, is still preliminary, and the researchers who generated it concede that it has many flaws.

The bill, which has already passed the Senate, would require contractors to pay so-called prevailing wages -- which means high union wage rates -- on \"public works.\" But public works doesn't refer just to bridges, schools and other public projects. It also includes private projects that rely on government grants and tax subsidies.    Most low-income housing projects rely on tax subsidies to attract private capital. So the bill would catch the small, often minority contractors who build and renovate housing with non-union labor. By forcing them to pay union wages, the bill would double labor costs -- raising, for example, the cost of fixing an apartment from $8,000 to $13,000 and forcing up rents by about $40 a month.
