And the colt who was launched this time was Distinct Reality, winning his second straight race and doing it against a field of six other juveniles with breeding, credentials and great expectations.   Distinct Reality ran a textbook sprint with Jerry Bailey riding, kept his poise when Fabulous Force shot the first quarter-mile in 21 1/5 seconds and the half-mile in 44 4/5 seconds, and then kicked into high in the homestretch. At the wire of the five-and-one-half-furlong race, he had two lengths on Gusto Z, who in turn had a length and a half on Slew Gen Fizz.  Then it was more than three lengths back to the favorite, Code Home. Lacking a Past    Juveniles are probably the least predictable horses in the business, and for good reasons.

Cuomo reached agreement today on a bill that would expand restrictions on smoking by prohibiting smoking in schools and limiting it in workplace lounges and cafeterias to separate, enclosed rooms.   The bill also would ban smoking in general hospitals, child-care centers, public institutions and treatment centers for children, ticketing and boarding areas of public transportation terminals, indoor zoos and some food stores. It also would ban the sale of individual cigarettes out of their packages, which include warnings about the health hazards of smoking.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930706","headline":"Blimp Pilot Tried to Avoid Crash in City","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/06/nyregion/blimp-pilot-tried-to-avoid-crash-in-city.html","abstract":"  The co-pilot of the blimp that crashed onto a Manhattan apartment building Sunday described the frantic final minutes of the flight yesterday, saying the craft's problems appeared suddenly, making the airship \"uncontrollable\" and leaving its pilot desperately trying to steer away from the city's skyline.   \"We didn't want to go near the buildings,\" said the co-pilot, Pat Russell, 49, speaking from his bed at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. \"It became uncontrollable to where we just drifted in.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930706","headline":"For Libyan Athletes, an Appeal to Clinton","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/06/sports/sports-people-track-and-field-for-libyan-athletes-an-appeal-to-clinton.html","abstract":"  World University Games officials appealed directly to PRESIDENT CLINTON yesterday to allow 79 student athletes from Libya to compete in the multisport event, which begins Thursday in Buffalo.

It is much needed and appreciated, as the attendance shows.    But as a taxpayer who visited the park several times to play tennis, I am wondering how some glitches occurred even before its opening. For example, there are already cracks visible to the first visitors. The one bathroom near the 138th Street area was out of service for weeks. Of the four courts, only two are really playable; one is without a net, and the surface on two is buckled badly on the back courts.

Black 47 represented New York's young Irish immigrants. And the clarinetist Don Byron led a 10-member klezmer band in music by Mickey Katz, the clarinetist, composer and arranger whose comedy songs were hits from 1947 to the mid-1950's.   Most of the music was lighthearted (though Black 47 started with earnestly political songs) and vigorously entertaining. But behind it was an inventory of immigrant survival strategies, between assimilation and insularity. Songs by Katz, who died in 1985, and by Black 47's Larry Kirwan rally their respective ethnic groups with inside jokes and musical echoes of the old country, while facing outsiders with a laugh, a partial explanation and touches of American music.

Reuters reported that the couple were on their way to the Eden Roc Hotel in Cap d'Antibes when a car swerved in front of their vehicle, forcing it to stop. Four men with semiautomatic pistols surrounded the limousine, grabbed the chauffeur and took the keys to the trunk, where they found the jewelry and cash in a handbag, the report said. The incident occurred so quickly that bodyguards following in a car had no time to intervene, it added.    The police said the robbery had been meticulously planned. They said they later found the getaway car, containing some of the Davises' personal documents, and arrested two French passengers, said to be accomplices in the robbery. The police said the two would be taken before a judge today to be placed under investigation -- a prelude to criminal charges -- for receiving stolen property.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930707","headline":"An End to Nuclear Testing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/07/opinion/an-end-to-nuclear-testing.html","abstract":"  For nearly half a century, test explosions in the Nevada desert were a reverberating reminder of cold war insecurity.
