They fight with varying degrees of talent and precious little style; sometimes, only  raw strength carries them through 4 to 10 rounds (each round counted off by a \"card girl,\" who wears less than the fighters and often gets more attention).","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UNION SQUARE;From Suppers of Legend to a Spot on Dormitory Row","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/nyregion/neighborhood-report-union-square-suppers-legend-spot-dormitory-row.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"PRACTICAL TRAVELER;Airline Food Keeps Shrinking","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/travel/practical-traveler-airline-food-keeps-shrinking.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"New Life for Abandoned and Derelict Edison Homes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/realestate/new-life-for-abandoned-and-derelict-edison-homes.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Books in Brief: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/books/books-in-brief-nonfiction.html","abstract":"MEN-OF-WAR By Patrick O'Brian.

Bored? Is the monotony of everyday life leaving you dead? HOLDING ON (Norton, $25), a collection of profiles of more than 50 American characters, will either cheerfully remind you that somewhere creative people pursue offbeat  passions or leave you annoyed that you are not among them. Take Robert Shields,  the author of the world's longest diary, a minute-by-minute account that comprises more than 34 million words; or Dewey Chafin, a snake handler in West Virginia who says, \"Why I do it is because the Bible says to do it, and that's just the bottom line.\" Many of the people interviewed in \"Holding On\" are included not because of their personal peculiarities but because they are walking and (thankfully) talking bearers of history -- like Sylvia (Ray) Rivera, a drag queen, and Seymour Pine, a retired police officer, who faced off against  each other at the 1969 Stonewall riots; or Geneva Tisdale, a cook at the Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C., who recalls the student sit-ins there in 1960. The radio producer David Isay, who wrote the text, and Harvey Wang, who took the photographs, respect the distinctive lives they document in the book. As the novelist Henry Roth says in his foreword: \"Exercising creativity helps us preserve one of our proudest, most noble, most precious possessions: dignity. As far as I'm concerned, dead, it doesn't matter whether we did or didn't preserve it. Comes to the same thing. . . .

Who cares about practicalities? Comfort? Mais non! As any Frenchwoman will tell you, it is the total look that counts, shoes included. \n\n     Yet, there they were, these same chic, sanctimonious Parisians, trotting down the grand boulevards last month in overcoats and les baskets. For the first few  days of the general strike, they insisted on wearing their patent-leather slingbacks and faux-alligator pumps, even if they were pounding the pavement for two hours to work and back.

So are the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's for that matter. \n\n      There comes a time for every aspiring book publisher when she recognizes that her career, though inspired by Mary McCarthy's, will not resemble it. After a few weeks steeped in proposals for self-help books or unauthorized biographies of cable-access television stars, she realizes that there is no longer a May Day parade, a byline in The Nation is no longer immediately accessible to 22-year-old English majors, two-bedroom apartments on Jane Street are out of the single girl's price range, and Webster Hall is no longer filled with the literati but with drag queens. There comes a point when she notices that although she studied Homer, Austen and Melville, she will not be publishing them. There are a few holdouts from the \"literary\" camp, to be sure (the assistant may find herself remarking on the fact that here, in the world books,  \"Literature\" is considered a category as specific as \"how to\" or \"occult\"), but  there seem to be a disporortionate number of Oprah bios, guides to better sexual relationships and near-death-experience books, slugged for those on the inside as N.D.E. \"A new N.D.E. title,\" screams the publisher, dollar signs glowing in her contact lenses. \"Isn't this to die for?\" To the publisher, N.D.E. means big  excitment and big bucks. To the assistant it can also stand for \"not doing editing,\" \"not drinking enough\" or \"nasty, despondent employee.\"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Press Faces Repression In Africa","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/world/press-faces-repression-in-africa.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"World"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Correction: A Retirement Portfolio","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/business/c-correction-a-retirement-portfolio-068675.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"The View From: Hartford;A Synagogue With a Legacy for New Immigrants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/nyregion/the-view-from-hartford-a-synagogue-with-a-legacy-for-new-immigrants.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Egypt Sentences 6 To Death for Attacks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/world/egypt-sentences-6-to-death-for-attacks.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"World"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"SPORTS PEOPLE: PRO BASKETBALL;Tarpley Off to Greece?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/sports/sports-people-pro-basketball-tarpley-off-to-greece.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Hotels, Hotels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/travel/l-hotels-hotels-067393.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Economy Is Seen As Slightly Stronger","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/nyregion/economy-is-seen-as-slightly-stronger.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"ON THE STREET;What Becomes a Blizzard Most?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/style/on-the-street-what-becomes-a-blizzard-most.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Style"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Lost and Found","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/books/l-lost-and-found-067610.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Croats and Muslims Said to Clash in Bosnia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/world/croats-and-muslims-said-to-clash-in-bosnia.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"World"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Siberia Belies Its Somber Image","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/travel/siberia-belies-its-somber-image.html","abstract":"WHEN my friends in Moscow heard that I was going to Siberia in February, they said, \"It's going to be cold.\" Actually, it was not that cold. Awaiting an Arctic blast as I stepped off the plane into the Siberian snow, I found myself feeling no more chilled than I would on a ski vacation. \n\n     Instead of the dark, frozen place of exile that I had expected -- home of the gulag and the salt mine -- I found streets filled with shoppers and vendors and  fur-hatted peasants carrying purchases home on mules. Shops were stocked with fresh fruit and stylish clothing, and crowded restaurants served hearty traditional fare like Siberian dumplings and stews. Residents, I learned, tend to flee not the cold, but the summer months, when temperatures soar to near 100  degrees and inchlong mosquitoes come out of hibernation. I had come to Siberia on business to study the economic life of the region, but during my 10-day stay  discovered much to enjoy. Siberia is surprisingly sunny in the winter months, when the deep colors of the forest shine against the snow.  The dark green taiga -- this is what the Siberians call their stunted pine forest -- is edged with the white of birch trees under a slate-blue sky. The huge Siberian land mass, bigger than the United States and Europe together, is mostly taiga. It runs 4,350 miles east of the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, unchanging, hardly  touched by humans.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/sports/results-plus-069515.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"TRAVEL ADVISORY;Caribbean Resorts Set Post-Storm Reopenings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/travel/travel-advisory-caribbean-resorts-set-post-storm-reopenings.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"INVESTING IT;Bets Against Technology Pay Off for Bearish Fund","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/business/investing-it-bets-against-technology-pay-off-for-bearish-fund.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Editorial Notebook;State of the Something","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/opinion/editorial-notebook-state-of-the-something.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"A Sleuth Gets His Suspect: Shakespeare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/us/a-sleuth-gets-his-suspect-shakespeare.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960114","headline":"G.I.

Melbourne, stood a lone weatherboard hut amid glowing spinifex grass and twisting gum trees. Davey Williamson spent his summers there along with his wife, children, some rabbits and a whole lot of cows, just around the bend from  craggy Mount Kosciusko. Other settlers followed, and watched their cows grow fat on the land after each lean, cold winter. \n\n      Then, around 1944, the government came along and decided to use the mountain, Australia's highest, for a hydroelectric plan. The whole million-acre  region was declared a national park and all grazing stopped as work got under way. Dozens of families who had followed the Williamsons abandoned their pastures but let their dwellings stand, turning the area into a virtual museum of early Australian settlement. Today, the enormous system of reservoirs and dams that makes up the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme runs through the hills and fields dominated by these old dwelling places, where people from Sydney and Melbourne come to spend time in the unforgiving landscape of their ancestors.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"Hotels, Hotels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/travel/l-hotels-hotels-067377.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960114","headline":"WEDDINGS;Lisa T.
