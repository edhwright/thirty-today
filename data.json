Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, released a new television commercial this week that tries to burnish his image as a hardened crime fighter with a soft touch for the common folk. The commercial, one of three new radio and television commercials released this week, neatly prefaced a major speech by Mr. Giuliani yesterday that brought together his anti-crime proposals. PRODUCER   The Garth Group of New York. ON THE SCREEN   The one-minute commercial has the gritty texture and quick pacing of the 11 o'clock television news. It opens in a Brooklyn restaurant kitchen where a worker surrounded by collanders and pans waxes nostaglic about times when people weren't afraid to sit outside at night. In rapid succession, tight shots of people identified as Brooklyn community activists in various locations -- a book-lined room, a city park, an office -- talking about neighborhoods gripped by fear of crime. Then scenes of Mr. Giuliani walking under an elevated subway talking animatedly to a young man, bending down to chat with an elderly woman, shaking hands with a woman outside a city housing project. At the end, underneath a shot of the restaurant worker, are the words: \"Rudolph Giuliani -- You know (underlined) he'll be tough on crime.\" THE SCRIPT   Paul Balsamo, restaurant worker: \"I remember when I was a kid, that Avenue N used to be lined with people just sitting out in front of their houses or in front of their apartments at night to cool off. And you don't see that anymore because everybody's afraid to come out at night.\"   Madge Ford, community activist: \"We, as honest, tax-payin' citizens, are really tired of living behind iron bars and the criminals going free.\"   Carlos Hernandez, anti-drug activist: \"You can't even stand out with kids or in front of our stores because we might be afraid there might be a shootout, might be something happening.\"   Myrtle Whitmore, community activist: \"There seems to be no one at the top to say, look guys, this has got to stop. Now Rudolph Giuliani was a U.S. Attorney. He was our lawyer. He's gone to bat for us.\"   Ms. Ford: \"Rudy Giuliani could bring this city together by first getting rid of the problems that separate us.\"   Mr. Balsamo: \"That would be a very big help to us. Just to keep the neighborhood a little safer and make it safer for our kids.\" SCORECARD   The commercial tries to capture Mr. Giuliani's overarching vision of a gentler city while making a targeted pitch to voters in Brooklyn, where the mayoral battle is expected to be close. By having speakers who are white, Hispanic and black talk about Mr. Giuliani's effectiveness as a crime fighter, the commercial tries to convey the message that his support is broad based, that his message cuts across racial lines and that he could be a racial healer -- something he needs people to believe if they are going to vote against the city's first black mayor. And while touting Mr. Giuliani as a tough prosecutor, it suggests that Mayor David N. Dinkins has been soft on criminals -- a theme that may resonate with some voters but also may seem hollow to liberals who contend Mr. Dinkins has expanded the police department at the expense of other city services.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930924","headline":"A Return Trip to Vietnam","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/style/IHT-a-return-trip-to-vietnam.html","abstract":"An hour's drive from Ho Chi Minh City, you can visit one of the most remarkable engineering feats of any war, the remnants of the Cu Chi tunnels, a 250-kilometer network. .The U.S. helicopter on display in the jungle near the tunnels has \"Charlie","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930924","headline":"On My Mind; A Charity No More","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/opinion/on-my-mind-a-charity-no-more.html","abstract":"  I had doubts about the Clinton health plan -- too complicated, too much new bureaucracy, and where was the money to come from?

Here, the Trenton poor and the Princeton Ivy Leaguers vote Democratic, the prosperous business suburbanites favor Republicans, and Gerald R. Stockman and Richard J. LaRossa are struggling in a Senate race for the same shifting middle that will probably decide the race for governor as well.   For Democrats like Mr. Stockman and Gov. Jim Florio, the 15th was once considered so safe a seat that Mr. Stockman, then a 10-year incumbent State Senator, was chosen to sponsor Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990. The next year, Mr. La Rossa harnessed anger over the taxes to his fame as the man who called the state lottery results on television and won a humbling upset over Mr. Stockman. It was a defeat that the state Democrats ardently want to reverse. 'Not Something I Brag About'    \"This was the most Democratic district in the state until I lost,\" Mr. Stockman, a 57-year-old trial lawyer, said recently as he doggedly worked the sidewalks and front porches of Trenton's West Ward. \"It's not something I brag about.\" Indeed, Mr. La Rossa is the first Republican to represent the city of Trenton in the Senate since 1946, the year, he likes to point out, when he was born.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930924","headline":"Review/Photography; Another Side of a Life's Work, Elegantly Revealed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/arts/review-photography-another-side-of-a-life-s-work-elegantly-revealed.html","abstract":"  In the 1930's and 40's, George Platt Lynes achieved both fame and commercial success with cool, Surrealist-influenced photographs of fashion and dance, as well as portraits of such artists and writers as Jean Cocteau, E.

Since then, in each generation, similar dreams have drawn writers to New York City, among them Willie Morris and Dan Wakefield, the authors of two recent memoirs about the city.

This is surely one of the most comfortable and attractive restaurants to open in quite some time, a place for grown-ups to go for quiet conversation and civilized service. Unfortunately, this is a fast romance, over before you even make an exit. Madeo may have an appealing Italian accent, but it is a restaurant best suited to major meat eaters. People who are entranced by encounters with huge haunches of meat will be happy here; those in the mood for interesting appetizers and delicate plates of pasta will not.   The cool beige restaurant, which has just arrived on West 55th Street, is already filled with an international crowd of extremely attractive people. That may be because it is the third member of the Madeo family. The original is in Forte dei Marmi, a Tuscan seaside resort. The second occupies a basement in the former International Creative Management building in Los Angeles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930924","headline":"Flute Club Concert","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/arts/flute-club-concert.html","abstract":"  The New York Flute Club is to present a concert by the winners of its 1993 competition, on Sunday at 6:30 P.M. at CAMI Hall, 165 West 57th Street, Manhattan.

Realists will recognize the installation, which has just gone on view, for what it is: a prudent, serious, often provocative, overdue self-examination of the richest and by far the most influential presentation of 20th-century art in the world, one that has come to define the canon of modernism.

But for two dozen young medical students here, the President's speech on health care offered a glimpse into their own future as doctors, and many came away profoundly nervous.    \"We're going to have a nation of Doc-in-the-Boxes,\" said 24-year-old Richard Gardner, a fourth-year student at Baylor College of Medicine here. \"His idea seems to be that all doctors are going to go right into H.M.O.'s.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930924","headline":"California Players Spared Sanctions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/sports/sports-people-high-schools-california-players-spared-sanctions.html","abstract":"  The California Scholastic Federation decided yesterday not to punish eight high school basketball players who attended an all-star tournament sponsored by Nike earlier this month, even though a violation was committed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930924","headline":"Review/Film; Conscience And Images: A Wordless World Tour","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/movies/review-film-conscience-and-images-a-wordless-world-tour.html","abstract":"  Film technology and global consciousness have both come a long way since the quaint old days when \"This Is Cinerama\" was the leading edge of wide-screen film spectacle and the Seven Wonders of the World were touted as the hit parade of international tourist attractions.

The original dining room is the more charming of the two, with a painted tin ceiling, pale yellow walls, a wall montage of vegetables and vines, and fine old wood serving tables. The larger, newer room, which brings the restaurant's capacity to 140, is more austere and produces echoes.   An antipasto buffet offers a selection of tantalizing appetizers. Among the best are the grilled shrimp with white beans and escarole; terrine of eggplant and roasted peppers; grilled shiitake mushrooms and fennel salad, and Tuscan lentil salad with pancetta and garlic.   Pizzas, have thin, dense crusts. The toppings are fresh and brightly seasoned. The Cucina pizza, for example, has artichoke, grilled eggplant, salty soppressata (a smoked sausage of pork and bacon), fennel, tomato and mozzarella.

John tends a busy kitchen turning out zesty home-style food, while Camille warmly greets neighborhood patrons in the 25-seat dining room.   Portions are generous indeed, even for the bread, which may be a sesame-seed baguette one evening, a crusty peasant loaf the next. Among the appetizers are grilled mozzarella panini with a pesto of roasted red peppers; cod croquettes with an arugula-and-garlic sauce, and shrimp kebabs with lentil salad and a citrus-and-parsley sauce.

No-nonsense waiters appear to have worked there forever, and if you ask for a menu, one might respond: \"No menu. How do you like your steak?\"   Actually, there are a few other options, although steak is king here. You can get a well-broiled porterhouse steak, dry-aged and full of flavor (portions serve one to four); thick double lamb chops, and good broiled fish.

It is not always easy to distinguish from social work, and it is certainly a long way in conception from the old model of \"plop\" art, with its casual regard for the relationship between sculpture and site. The new public art also goes beyond the percent-for-art programs that emerged during the 1970's and 80's and aspired to bring artists and architects closer together in planning new buildings and urban designs.   The latest brand of public art is something else again: artists collaborating directly with the communities that will come into contact with the work, the process of collaboration becoming, in many cases, as important as the end result.   The approach, strictly speaking, isn't new. Its roots -- and the problems it poses -- go back at least to the 1960's, grounded as they are in movements like Process Art and Performance Art, and in the left-wing political activism that moved artists of that time from their studios to the streets (not only here but abroad, as in London, where Conrad Atkinson and Stephen Willats collaborated with workers from the East End). The political art of recent years has spawned a new generation of artists and curators who have picked up strands of 60's thinking and adapted them to 90's issues.   The latest manifestation of the new public art has been in evidence here, during the last few months, in a program that winds down this week called \"Culture in Action.\" It was sponsored by Sculpture Chicago, supported by money from the National Endowment for the Arts and various private groups and organized by Mary Jane Jacob, an independent curator. The program (total cost around $800,000) is actually eight separate projects, mostly in neighborhoods distant -- if not geographically, then economically and sociologically -- from Chicago's gleaming commercial heart.   The outcomes of such projects have been about as far from the towering Picasso and Calder sculptures that adorn Chicago's Loop as can be imagined; they have taken the form of block parties and parades, paint charts, chocolate bars and hydroponically grown leafy vegetables.    One project is based in the hotly contested area near Maxwell Street, for a century a thriving Old World bazaar in the shadow of the Loop. There, city planners and a nearby university have combined to raze blocks as part of a scheme to build athletic fields and other structures and eliminate the busy marketplace that still caters mostly to low-income people.   Another project took place on a West Town street, a couple of miles west of the Loop, occupied mainly by Latinos and fractured by competing gangs. Yet another took place in a factory where a dozen union workers from a large chocolate company banded together to design their own candy bar and wrapper. And a project that involved hundreds of people united members of disparate communities across the city, including a Mexican-American neighborhood around Harrison Park and the black neighborhood around Garfield Park.   The Chicago program is only one example of the new public art. In a kind of collaboration with their South Bronx neighbors, John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres have produced sculptures depicting residents of that community. Other public art blurs the division between advertising and art, volunteerism and Conceptualism. The red ribbon that has come to symbolize concern about AIDS was conceived by artists who belong to a group called Visual Aids -- a whopping success by the standards of the new public art.    Programs like the one here in Chicago highlight many of the knotty questions that the new public art raises. The questions are not only about esthetics. They are also about the often fine line dividing exploitation and collaboration in the relationships between artists and their communities. Such programs raise the now inevitable questions about public financing, too: Would the money be better spent on established social programs, not to mention art that aspires to something more visually ambitious than a leafy vegetable?   How, in fact, do you compare a leafy vegetable with a park designed by Vito Acconci, much less with a Titian? For that matter, how do you compare the social service provided by these art projects with the work done by real social service organizations?   AND HOW DO YOU COMPARE SUCH projects even with the political art that filled the last Whitney Biennial and the Aperto at the Venice Biennale? An essential element distinguishes this new public art from much of what was on view in New York and Italy: it eschews galleries and museums, where such art often takes on a boutiquish odor. The work may stem from the same ideas and idealism that inspire artists to make sculptures and installations for more conventional sites, but it takes those ideas in a different direction. It is not primarily about addressing the traditional art public and its debates over quality.   What may come to mind is the recent brouhaha involving three artists in Southern California who doled out $10 bills to undocumented migrant workers. By all accounts, that publicity stunt masquerading as art had nothing to do with serious collaboration between the artists and the workers; both as social service and as a meditation on the problems at the Mexican-American border it was laughably meager. Its real audience was the art world and its critics, among whom the gesture of giving away public money for the arts had precisely the intended incendiary effect. Had it not provoked a response from that group, the whole gesture would have been, on the face of it, empty.   One can think of that California project as the new public art at its worst. But much of the new public art is different. It almost always derives from good intentions. Of course, the streets of Chicago's West Side are paved with them.   Some of the \"Culture in Action\" projects are examples of such well-intended duds. Suzanne Lacy, who for years has been putting together spectacles and performances that involve large groups of people, organized one of the most disappointing and tradition-bound projects with a group of women from around the city. The group drew up a list of 100 local women of distinction, dead and alive, chosen from more than 400 nominations solicited through newspapers and women's organizations; then limestone rocks, each embedded with a brass plate bearing the name of one of the women, were distributed around the Loop.    The impulse to recognize the achievements of these mostly unheralded women was admirable. But the rocks, with their small and difficult-to-read plaques, turn out to be undistinguished testimonials to distinguished women, clunky obstacles on busy streets where they may be likelier to annoy than to enlighten passers-by. As to an even more questionable component of Ms. Lacy's project, a dinner party to which Gloria Steinem, Anita Hill and a small group of other prominent women have been invited, it is difficult to see why such a private event, oddly caricaturing Caryl Churchill's caustic 1983 play, \"Top Girls,\" should be underwritten by a public art program (even if it is videotaped for outsiders to see).   Another dubious project involved the artists Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler, who asked a group of residents of Ogden Courts Apartments, a housing project, to help them design a paint chart, each color relating to some event in the history of public housing or some aspect of life in such housing -- Urban Renewal Lime, Cabrini Green, Pruitt-Igoe Dust. (It is being distributed in paint stores.)    Some Ogden Courts residents, Ms. Jacob volunteered, wondered quite understandably what possible benefit they derived from contributing to this artsy exercise, especially one that reduced catastrophes like Pruitt-Igoe to something as decorous as a wall coloring. It was agreed that after completing the chart, Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler would collaborate with the residents on thinking up something more to the point.   Yet another well-meaning but fuzzily conceived project is by a quartet of artists who call themselves Haha. In a storefront in Rogers Park, near Evanston, they have joined a group of residents and others to create a hydroponic garden. The aim is to make the storefront a meeting place for AIDS volunteers and people interested in discussing AIDS, the garden becoming both a source of therapeutic food for people with AIDS and a metaphor for nurturing and caring.   The artists in Haha are sensitive people dealing with an immense problem about which they are trying, as artists, to make some constructive statement. But with all the serious work to be done and already being done by volunteer AIDS organizations, the project seems hopelessly precious, not to say ineffectual. The garden is too small to be much of a contribution, and in any case, its physiological benefits are questionable. And where is the art in all this? As metaphor, the garden is trite. As interior design, the storefront is unexceptional. Surely this can't be described as good Performance or Process Art, either, even by the most generous definitions of those terms.   SO WHAT ARE THE BEST OF THE \"Culture in Action\" projects? A local artist named Inigo Manglano-Ovalle organized a block party on Erie Street near Wood Street in West Town, collaborating over many months with children and teen-agers, gangs, and community organizations. For the party, which took place late last month, more than 70 video monitors were set up along the street. They displayed videotapes of neighborhood residents made by the young people with whom Mr. Manglano-Ovalle collaborated. The young people were trained in the use of video; they decided on the subject matter of the tapes, and some of the equipment they used was contributed to the neighborhood after the project was finished so the young people could continue to make videos with it.   Gangs that usually fight over turf banded together for the party and for the supervision of the street. And where was the art here? In the more than 40 visually lively tapes made by the young people. In the theater of the party. And in the peculiarly artistic demonstration of community solidarity.   Another project was put together by Daniel J. Martinez, the artist responsible for the notorious \"I Can't Imagine Ever Wanting to Be White\" buttons at the Whitney Biennial. For \"Culture in Action\" he did something as sensitive and upbeat as the buttons were crude and off-putting. He spent around two years enlisting 800 volunteers from Mexican-American and black neighborhoods that don't generally mix with each other. The group organized a colorful, costume-filled parade that moved from one neighborhood to the other, stopping in between at Maxwell Street. Like Mr. Manglano-Ovalle's project, this was an artistic, theatrical illustration of community organization and embrace.   At the same time, Mr. Martinez created an installation on a fenced-in lot near Maxwell Street that is owned by the University of Illinois at Chicago, which is trying to drive out the market. The installation (done without the university's involvement) consists of a platform made from giant granite blocks. The blocks come from a plaza that the university designed during the mid-60's for its campus several blocks away.   That plaza partook of the sort of now discredited liberal design mentality of the time that obliterated old neighborhoods and replaced them with housing projects. Its destruction, and the use of its remains on the disputed site of an old neighborhood that the university asserts it will improve by eliminating is thus full of reverberations and double-entendres. The platform Mr. Martinez has created also suggests a giant soapbox, a place for speakers to exhort crowds. His sentiments are clearly with one side. But his spare installation avoids preaching and, like good political art, aims at provoking serious debate without pretending to be able to effect major change.   There are obviously plenty of pitfalls with the new public art. One of the most dangerous, condescending assumptions that can underlie it is ghettoization under the guise of public outreach -- that art for lower-income communities, immigrant communities, must take the form of social activism, that the history of Western culture as presented in museums is irrelevant to such people.   Yet another danger -- perhaps an inevitability -- is that such projects as \"Culture in Action\" will be imitated by every arts organization that wants to seem trendy and politically correct, turning what should be painstaking and long-term community involvement into the quick-hit, radical-chic, plop art of the 90's. Fly in the artists, stage an event with the city's downtrodden, alert the media! Ms. Jacob says she has already received calls from organizations around the country that would like her to put together in their cities something similar to what she put together in Chicago. No wonder she is reluctant to speak of paradigms.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930926","headline":"Miss Prezzano And Mr. Durfee","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/26/style/weddings-miss-prezzano-and-mr-durfee.html","abstract":"  Katherine Prezzano, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs. E.

The festival's arrival in Budapest is yet another sign that Eastern Europe is fast joining Western Europe spiritually, if not politically and economically.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930926","headline":"For Penn State, 4-0; For Rutgers, Deja Vu","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/26/sports/college-football-for-penn-state-4-0-for-rutgers-deja-vu.html","abstract":"  The game was a rerun, a replay of so many Penn State-Rutgers matches of the past.

A compulsive observer who leaned toward the azure blues and fiery reds of the Fauves, he was a painter who saw the exotic in the everyday. \"Art will never be able to do without nature,\" Bonnard once wrote, a belief emphasized in his diary, which in 20 years contained but three short reflections on society. Instead, its pages of crablike script were devoted to precise notations on the weather and scores of pencil sketches executed in or around his home at Le Cannet, the sun-drenched village in the south of France where he lived for most of each year. Jean Leymarie, an art historian and an acquaintance of Bonnard's, and Michel Terrasse, the painter's great-nephew, have coupled their memories of the painter, his house and gardens with more than 130 related illustrations, 77 in color, to illustrate the sources of Bonnard's art and methods. The result, BONNARD AT LE CANNET (Thames and Hudson, paper, $24.95), is a handsome book, unusual for the intimate portrait it presents of the painter's private world and for the poetry of its text, which shimmers with detail. Mr. Leymarie, in his preface, and Mr. Terrasse, in the main text, have caught small, significant moments -- snippets of conversation, the decorations of a room, the quality of light during an early morning stroll -- and shared them with the reader. The photographs have been arranged by setting and divided into sections (the garden, the dining room, the studio and so on), each introduced by a small drawing or a page from Bonnard's diary. Fourteen penetrating photographs of Bonnard in his rooms by Henri Cartier-Bresson echo the intense symbiosis between the artist and his domestic world. \"Every true artist finds the subjects that he needs,\" said Bonnard, who found them all close to home.
