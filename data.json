But these days the foundation is under scrutiny from many quarters for the way it conducted itself, from the actual fund raising to the way the money was spent. Of $9.7 million collected through direct mail between September 1992 and December 1993, none went to purchase toys, although some toys were bought with corporate donations, said Lieut. Gen. Matthew T. Cooper, a retired Marine commander who was appointed president and chief executive of the foundation last fall. \"It all went to pay the expenses of direct mail,\" he said.  Holes in the Bookkeeping    In April the chairman and president, Jerry L. King, was dismissed after board members discovered he had been convicted of tax evasion and other crimes, all unrelated to his foundation work.

The old gunslinger ballads gave way to bloodier and more morally ambiguous sagas (movies like\"Shane\" were replaced by movies like \"The Wild Bunch\"), and then in the mid-1970's, the genre of the western itself seemed ready to fade away and die. Meanwhile, however, a new brand of movie hero began to make his way to the screen: Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry, a renegade cop willing to break all the rules; Charles Bronson's one-man vigilante team in \"Death Wish\" (and \"Death Wish 2,\" \"3\" and \"4\") and, of course, Sylvester Stallone's pumped-up ex-Green Beret, John Rambo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940211","headline":"Cup May Have Women's Team","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/11/sports/cup-may-have-women-s-team.html","abstract":"  It is likely that there will be an all-women's team in the 1995 America's Cup defense races, according to Bill Koch, the wealthy yachtsman whose America   team successfully defended the cup in 1992.   \"We would like to break the tradition that has resulted in almost entirely a male-dominated sport in the 142 years since the first race,\" Koch said in a statement today.

Two years ago in a poll of PGA players published in The New York Times, Purtzer was voted the player with the best swing in golf.   Then, like an opera singer waking up without a voice, Purtzer suddenly lost the sweet swing. He was working out on an exercise machine, twisted the wrong way and injured his back. To avoid pain while swinging, he changed his motion. The tiny, almost imperceptible flaw that crept into his swing changed one of the finest, purest ball strikers in golf into a confused and uncertain man who often had no idea where the ball was going when he stepped up to hit a shot. 'Like Watching a Pro-Am'    \"I was hitting shots I had never hit before,\" said Purtzer, 42 years old, who today shot a round of 64, seven under par, two shots better than Chip Beck and Jesper Parnevik and three better than a group that included Fred Couples, Corey Pavin, Jay Delsing, Nolan Henke and David Frost in the first round of the Nissan Los Angeles Open. \"In laymen's terms, it was like watching a pro-am.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940211","headline":"House Votes to Restore Independent Counsel Law","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/11/us/house-votes-to-restore-independent-counsel-law.html","abstract":"  The House voted overwhelmingly today to put the independent counsel law, first enacted in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, back on the statute books.
