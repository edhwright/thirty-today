His tip is \"Play your honor earlier if it is of no use,\" and he mentions a famous episode that decided the 1975 World Team Championship: An American player, defending seven clubs, held K-10 doubleton of clubs and found the A-Q doubleton in dummy on his left.

The series, which opened on Monday evening at the Walter Reade Theater, is no longer a forum for new music ensembles of all stripes, as it was during its early years. Now the organization has a house band, the Bang on a Can All-Stars, who play its concerts and make recordings. Only the annual marathon (this year's is on May 21 at Alice Tully Hall) is the kind of omnibus offering that won Bang on a Can attention when it started nine years ago.   That said, the All-Stars are not a bad band by art-rock standards, and one could argue that in taking on all the performing chores, they are presenting a broader repertory than a series of composer-led ensembles would yield. Works by seven composers were played on Monday, and although there were both hits and misses, the program suggested that composers interested in combining elements of rock, jazz, unstructured noise and narrative structure are still finding fresh ground and are apparently feeling entirely unconstrained.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950316","headline":"Ballet Drawn From Danza","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/16/arts/dance-review-ballet-drawn-from-danza.html","abstract":"  Ballets de San Juan, Puerto Rico's oldest ballet troupe, romped into town for a rare New York appearance on Saturday night and established itself as a company of special charm and warmth.

The San Juan company was founded in 1954 by Ana Garcia, who haddanced with George Balanchine and Alicia Alonso. Miss Garcia's \"Pas de Quatre Criollo\" was a funny, knowing response to several famous ballets satirizing the egomaniacal stage manners of ballerinas.

It seems as if it has been around much longer, like a distant supernova whose light has just reached the eyes of earth. With this work, and with his 15th Symphony, Shostakovich began a new stylistic progression that death immediately cut short. The sonata does not carry forward the anguished personal dramas of the late quartets; it exists on a plane of pure music, conversing with voices out of the past. A ghostly echo of Beethoven's \"Moonlight\" glides through the finale. There is deep melancholy, but also deep repose.   Only a great musician can make sense of these profound simplicities, written at the edge of the grave. Yuri Bashmet made the music entirely his own on Tuesday night in one of the most important Carnegie Hall debuts in recent years. He gave lyric life to the score's endless strings of quarter notes and half notes, and he cast a fiery glow on the few stretches of wildness.

Everything about this plush, cozy space screams big city, from the conservatively dressed silver- and blond-haired clientele to the compressed space and comforting urban cuisine.   At first it is hard not to wonder how so many people can possibly ask for privacy in such tight quarters, but before long the Manhattan magic kicks in and the other tables fade into the background. If they surface now and then it is not due to the noise, which is low, but because this is the sort of restaurant where someone is always making an entrance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950317","headline":"Sounds Around Town","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/arts/sounds-around-town-056995.html","abstract":"  Celtic Folk-Rock   Rogue's March, Cafe a Go Go, 144 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-1241, and Paddy Reilly's, 519 Second Avenue, at 29th Street, Manhattan, (212) 686-1210. These New York City staples play Celtic-tinged folk-rock with unshakable pop hooks, mixing keyboards and guitars with mandolin and tin whistle. They celebrate drinking, depression and strife like the Pogues do, with jigs thickly coated in black humor. Songs like \"Shut Up and Drink\" and \"Amsterdam Mistress\" (which rhymes \"pints of Guinness\" with \"lots of slow kisses\") make for perfect St. Patrick's Day wallowing. The band performs at Paddy Reilly's at noon and at Cafe a Go Go at 10 P.M.; admission is free for the the noon performance and $7 for the later show. Phil Coulter Goes Southern    Phil Coulter, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. The Chieftains perform \"Tennessee Waltz\" on their new album, \"The Long Black Veil,\" and the long-standing Irish singer, composer and producer Phil Coulter performs \"The Yellow Rose of Texas\" on his new album, \"American Tranquillity.\" There's a connection between the music of Ireland and of the American South: both were born in farmhouses, at crossroads and under a vast, indifferent sky that promised to reward work with more work, struggle with more struggle and love with nothing. There are few better places to go tonight to find the connection between American and Irish folk, and between music and myth, than Carnegie Hall at 8 P.M. Tickets are $15 and $25. Tempered Rock and Rap    Black 47, Club Expo, 124 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 819-0377. \"Listen, robot, and listen good,\" Stevie Hero, the rock-and-roll protagonist in \"Days of Rage,\" a play by the Black 47 leader Larry Kirwan, yells shortly before he is shot by the police. \"This song is about someone who's decided to take a stand for what he believes in,\" Hero continues. That's a pretty good working definition of the music of Black 47, a proud band of talented New Yorkers who aren't afraid to temper their good-time Celtic rock and rap with lyrics about interracial relationships and Irish martyrs, even if it means resorting to the kind of hackneyed lines that Stevie Hero uses. The concert also includes the Niagaras and a squad of bagpipers from the New York City Police Department. Doors open at 5 P.M.; admission is $15. Promises of a Craic    Brian Conway, John Nolan and Don Meade, Blarney Star, 43 Murray Street, near City Hall, (212) 732-2873. In Ireland, a good-time jam session in a pub is known as a craic, and that's just how this concert promises to end. Brian Conway -- a prosecuting attorney by day, a tremendous fiddler by night -- plays in the Sligo style, creating wild, ornate melodies with speed, grace and ease. He'll be joined by John Nolan on accordion; Don Meade, the Blarney Star's booker, on banjo and guitar, and others. The music begins at 9 P.M.; admission is $10.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950317","headline":"Legal Action Is Threatened in Rams' Move","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/sports/sports-people-pro-football-legal-action-is-threatened-in-rams-move.html","abstract":"  The Rams appeared resigned yesterday to spending another season in California while National Football League Commissioner PAUL TAGLIABUE -- who opposed the move to St. Louis -- suggested relocation is still possible. \"The objective is to have teams in both places in a short-term time frame,\" Tagliabue said at the N.F.L. owners meetings in Phoenix.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950317","headline":"Old Redwoods Can Be Felled In California","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/us/old-redwoods-can-be-felled-in-california.html","abstract":"  California has decided to allow limited logging of giant redwoods in the last privately owned virgin stand of the trees in the world.

The piece is danced to David LaMarche's witty orchestration of rags by Scott Joplin, James Scott, Joseph Lamb and Artie Matthews. \"The Joplin Dances\" is, in effect, a loving and astute valentine to that wistfully melodic, jaunty music, opening in an empty cafe in which first one woman, then another waits impatiently for her late-arriving man.

The upbeat, brisk video consists of children talking about their favorite elements of New York architecture, and it starts with well-meaning but unsurprising voices of praise for the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center. But then the camera turns to an in-line skater, who is shown barreling at breakneck speed backward down the huge stone steps beside the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park. What's the greatest thing about New York? he is asked. \"The stairs,\" he replies without hesitation.    Alex loved this, and not only because he is a skater himself. I suspect it is also because he realized that this was the one moment in this ambitious exhibition in which one could actually see children reinventing the city for themselves. Those monumental stairs have one meaning for their architect, another for the generations who have used them for genteel promenades, and quite another altogether for the in-lane skaters for whom they represent not dignified monumentality, but the athletic challenge of a ski jump. The skaters have powerfully redefined this aspect of the city, not taking it away from the rest of us, but adding a whole new meaning of their own.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950317","headline":"The Bridge Stops Right Here, A Nonunion Builder Is Told","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/nyregion/the-bridge-stops-right-here-a-nonunion-builder-is-told.html","abstract":"  For six months, Dave Allan has been doing everything he can think of to rebuild a bridge on a highway to Jones Beach in time for summer.

It may be becoming so deeply in that it almost renders the very term an oxymoron. Still, an exceptional exhibition at the Swiss Institute in SoHo proves that for Americans at least, some significant surprises and discoveries remain.   This show introduces the art of Heinrich Anton Muller, a Swiss outsider, or self-taught, artist who died in 1930 at the age of 61. He's great, almost on a par with outsider giants like Adolf Wolfli (who was also Swiss), Martin Ramirez and Henry Darger. Muller's work is not a secret in Europe. Even in his lifetime, his large drawings of fantastical figures and animals were known to Hans Prinzhorn, the German psychiatrist who was among the first to write about and preserve the art of the insane. Muller's art received its first gallery exhibition in Paris in 1949 and was admired by Jean Dubuffet, who included it in his art brut collection. It also inspired other French artists, like Daniel Spoerri and Jean Tinguely, who both dedicated artworks to Muller, and was seen in the 1972 Documenta exhibition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950317","headline":"St. Anthony to Meet Shawnee in Final","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/sports/st-anthony-to-meet-shawnee-in-final.html","abstract":"  Anthony Perry scored 14 points, including the game-clinching layup, as third-seeded St. Anthony of Jersey City edged second-seeded Christian Brothers Academy, 55-52, in a New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association Tournament of Champions semifinal tonight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950317","headline":"Secretary of Transportation Will Not Face a Prosecutor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/us/secretary-of-transportation-will-not-face-a-prosecutor.html","abstract":"  Attorney General Janet Reno said today that she had dropped an inquiry into Transportation Secretary Federico F.

In earlier works, Ms. Tyson favored a softer, more modulated palette and her figures were more intricately detailed. These images seem starker and more potent: distilled and toughened.

Verdi's \"Traviata\" was restored to its traditional self at the New York City Opera on Thursday night, the company's gimmick-laden 1991 production unceremoniously retired in favor of a new production whose sole gimmick is that it is directed by the soprano Renata Scotto.    Ms. Scotto made her directorial debut in Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" at the Metropolitan Opera in 1986, singing the title role as well. In recent years she has become increasingly interested in opera direction, but she has created a \"Traviata\" that probably resembles many of the more average productions she has sung in. It has an almost old-fashioned operatic style. During Violetta's confrontation with Germont, for example, the courtesan turns several times and sings, with distraught, wide eyes, at the audience, awkwardly reminding everybody that this troubled woman is really a soprano onstage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950318","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/18/nyregion/no-headline-069695.html","abstract":"  \"The longer it lasts, you see, the harder it will be for anyone on either side to pick up a gun.

Plague-infected fleas were airdropped over Chinese cities, causing epidemics. Cholera and typhoid cultures were poured into wells. Prisoners were dissected alive without anesthetics.
