Patrick Ewing missed tonight's game with the flu. And the Knicks fell behind by 20 points in the first half.   Yet, New York trailed the Philadelphia 76ers by only 3 points on the game's final possession, needing only a 3-pointer to send the game into overtime. - Unfortunately for the Knicks, there were no last-second heroics. Rolando Blackman missed what would have been a game-tying 3-pointer from 24 feet with three seconds to play. Derek Harper deflected the rebound to Hubert Davis, who also missed a top-of-the-key jumper that would have been ruled a 2-pointer as the final buzzer sounded.   Thus, New York (52-21) dropped a frustrating 100-97 decision at the Spectrum, and lost a chance to capture its second consecutive Atlantic Division title. The Knicks' magic number for the division crown remained one, meaning they can win the division if the Orlando Magic loses at Miami on Saturday night, or if the Knicks defeat the Nets at Byrne Meadowlands Arena on Sunday afternoon.   Meanwhile, New York's lead over the Atlanta Hawks was cut to one and a half games in the race for best record in the Eastern Conference.   Ewing was in the locker room after the game, and said that he would play against the Nets. But he was obviously weak, and he may not be 100 percent Sunday. Ewing felt sick on Thursday, but his condition worsened gradually this afternoon. When it was time for the team to leave the hotel for the arena, Ewing was too sick to go.   \"I just feel sick, clammy,\" said Ewing, who watched part of the game at the team's hotel before coming to the arena. \"I'm still weak.\"   Yet, the Knicks felt they would have won without Ewing, if not for their poor first half. Certainly, New York never gave up against a 76er team (23-51) that played one of its best games of the season.   The Knicks appeared to be finished when Jeff Malone's baseline jumper gave Philadelphia a 97-92 lead with 1 minute 1 second to play. But Greg Anthony wouldn't quit. Anthony's driving layup pulled the Knicks to within 97-94 with 48.6 seconds to play. Then after Malone made only 1 of 2 free throws, Anthony made a 3-point jumper from the top of the key with 18.4 seconds to play, pulling the Knicks to within 98-97.   Greg Graham made two free throws with 11.1 seconds to play to set up the final sequence. After the inbounds pass, the ball was swung to Blackman, who head-faked Clarence Weatherspoon (26 points, 10 rebounds), set his feet, then let fly. Blackman thought the shot might fall, but it was short.   \"I got a good look at it, but the ball didn't go where I wanted it to: in the basket,\" Blackman said.   After Harper tipped the rebound to Davis, his shot went in and out at the buzzer. But the referees ruled that Davis's shot would have counted for 2 points even if it had gone in. So for the Knicks, their furious second-half rally was too little, too late.   Charles Oakley led the Knicks with 18 points and 18 rebounds.   \"We just dug ourselves a hole too deep,\" said Coach Pat Riley. \"It was a tough loss, considering what's at stake and what we're playing for. You can use any excuse you want. Yes, it hurt us not to have Patrick. It hurt us a lot. But we couldn't wallow in it.\" Plenty of Knicks Fans","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940409","headline":"The State of the State, Proudly Restated; Cuomo Writes the Book on New York's Strengths, and (Surprise!)

But he had a more impressive calling card than any reputation as a competition maverick.

His new recording of Mendelssohn piano sonatas is among the handsomest piano releases of the year.   Like many well-drilled Juilliard graduates, Mr. Chiu has a powerful, note-perfect technique. He showed it to good advantage in Prokofiev's Sixth Sonata and in \"Une Barque sur l'Ocean\" and \"Alborada del Gracioso\" by Ravel. Far more rare, there is real grace in his playing, an inborn elegance in his shaping of musical phrases. This he showed not only in the beguilingly atmospheric Ravel but also in the sharp-textured Prokofiev; he finds the lyric strand in Prokofiev's idiom that most pianists trample underfoot. Alongside the mighty sonata, he played his own arrangement of four pieces from \"Lieutenant Kije,\" languid to a fault but fully sympathetic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940409","headline":"BRIEFCASE: 2 Funds Reopen To New Investors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/09/your-money/IHT-briefcase-2-funds-reopen-to-new-investors.html","abstract":"One encouraging note amid the turmoil of the U.S. stock market last week: On Wednesday, the Mutual Shares and Mutual Qualified funds, two top \"value\" oriented funds, reopened to new investors.

The truth more often is that the more there is available on a subject, the greater the interest stirred up in it will be. Baseball fans surely will want to read both WOMEN IN BASEBALL: The Forgotten History (Praeger, $22.50), by Gai Ingham Berlage, and WHEN WOMEN PLAYED HARDBALL (Seal, paper, $14.95), by Susan E. Johnson. Ms. Johnson, a sociologist and a member of the Society for American Baseball Research, for the most part chronicles the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League from 1943 to 1954. Ms. Berlage, who teaches sociology at Iona College, places the history of the women's league within the larger story of women's interest in baseball from the end of the Civil War to the rise of girls' Little Leagues in the 1990's.   \"When Women Played Hardball\" is as much a fan's memoir as it is a history, somewhat in the manner of Lawrence S. Ritter's classic oral history, \"The Glory of Their Times,\" with the difference that Ms. Johnson had the extraordinary fortune to see her heroines at their peaks. Her book is built around the legendary 1950 championship series between the Rockford (Ill.) Peaches and the Fort Wayne (Ind.) Daisies, and includes wonderful recollections by the players. The author asked Alice Pollitt of the Peaches, \"Do you remember a wonderful play that you made, a great moment on the field?\" \"Yes,\" she replied \"with some relish.\" \"It was with Betsy Foss. I broke her leg.\" The book is particularly engaging because behind every historical anecdote is a personal recollection. For instance, Vivian Kellogg of the Grand Rapids (Mich.) Chicks showed Ms. Johnson a scrapbook of publicity photographs, including one of a teammate with the caption, \"Applying makeup is important to Ruth Lessing.\" The author asked if the caption was accurate. \"No,\" Ms. Kellogg answered. \"It was all just publicity.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940410","headline":"When Modern Was Brand New","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/arts/dance-view-when-modern-was-brand-new.html","abstract":"  IN MODERN DANCE, YOU CAN GO home again.

Works by Duncan, whose life was cut short in 1927 at age 49, have amazed New Yorkers since the 1970's, thanks in large part to the dedication and flair of Annabelle Gamson and the dancers she has influenced. More recently, reconstructions of pieces that by St. Denis and Shawn created for themselves and their Denishawn company have been performed with increasing credibility. This is especially true of productions supervised by Jane Sherman, who danced with Denishawn for three years, beginning in 1925, and Barton Mumaw, a protege of Shawn who appeared in Denishawn's final concert in 1931.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940410","headline":"Lori M.

Hola, Spain. What was Mona Lisa in Smithtown is now Cafe Barcelona. For more than a decade, the restaurant had an Italian name and menu, but its soul was Spanish. So, too, were its owners and chefs.    Cafe Barcelona shines with spanking-white stucco, mirrored walls and strings of white lights outlining its brick arches. Travel posters of Spain and wrought-iron chandeliers and sconces emphasize the Iberian flavor.    Mona Lisa always had some Spanish choices on its menu, and over the years knowing diners found them to be the restaurant's strength. Cafe Barcelona also sports a multinational menu, but stick with Spain. One Italian holdover, veal francese, was the only disappointing dish sampled. It had a soggy fall-away crust and was awash in a watery sauce.   For openers, order the Spanish potatoes ($2.95), the least expensive appetizer and the best. These homemade potato chips are crisp and chewy at the same time. They make a perfect nibble with drinks or a great side dish at entree time.    Other sterling Spanish starters are the shrimp ajillo, the platter of chorizos and the garlic soup. The shrimp were set over a sit-up-and-take-notice garlic sauce flecked with red-pepper flakes and parsley. The chorizos, Spanish sausages, were sliced in rounds and absolutely addictive. The spirited garlic soup, crowned with crunchy homemade croutons, awakened taste buds.    Also satisfying were the classic escargots and the avocado halves filled with tiny shrimp and crabmeat. Coming up short, though, was a marinated seafood salad dominated by surimi, imitation crabmeat. Caesar salad is large and recommended.   Our waiter, an amiable man, said that everyone at the table would be jealous of the person ordering the Galician pork chops. He was right. The three tender chops were smothered in peppers, onions and cubes of roasted potatoes. Twin veal chops receiving the same treatment also scored.   Veal extremena, fork-tender medallions combined with onions, peppers and slices of chorizo, was another Spanish sensation.    Two Iberian chicken dishes made beautiful memories, chunks of breast meat in a snappy garlic sauce and crunchy-crusted chicken villaroy. The villaroy consisted of two breasts that were coated with a creamy bechamel sauce and then breaded and baked.    A hearty beef dish also won our hearts. Medallions King Alfonso featured three butterflied filet mignons covered with a mushroom-laden brown sauce spiked with brandy.    Mariscada, the Spanish seafood stew, is a dish that often receives mixed notices. Cafe Barcelona's version is no exception. It is offered with a choice of green, red or garlic sauces. The nicely seasoned red sauce that we tried was a hit, but its briny partners were a varied lot. The sweet half- lobster was the star. Shrimp and scallops were supporting players. Clams were a mixed assembly of tender and chewy, and mussels were strong-tasting.    Shrimp in green sauce, a delicate amalgam infused with parsley and a touch of garlic, was a success. This subtle dish is not meant to be a rouser.    At dessert time, say adios to Spain. The flan is merely standard. Better bets are the various cheesecakes, the good pecan pie, the made-at-the-table zabaglione poured over sliced bananas and another tableside banana treat in which the fruit is flambeed in Kahlua and tequilla and served over ice cream.   The smooth, supple red wines of Spain often offer extraordinary value and exceptional quality. Thirteen of Cafe Barcelona's 19 wines are Spanish. Seven are from Rioja, the country's prime production area. Muga, a small family-run Rioja bodega that specializes in traditionally made, complex, aromatic wines, is well represented by its 1989 Reserve ($22.95), a ruby-colored red with a haunting fragrance. Muga's far less distinguished white ($18.95) is, nevertheless, a crisp, straightforward possibility.

Christy Mathewson obliged with a demonstration of his \"body swing\" -- now called a windup -- and Charles M. Conlon embarked on a 38-year career in which he virtually invented the iconography of the national pastime. Through 1942, Conlon (1868-1945) spent his summers carting his bulky Graflex camera (which until 1934 used glass negatives) to various ball parks to capture images of the players in action and in repose -- images so vivid and fresh that \"ballplayers from another era are standing in the sunshine of the 20th century,\" as Neal McCabe and Constance McCabe write in BASEBALL'S GOLDEN AGE: The Photographs of Charles M. Conlon (Abrams, $29.95). Conlon remained an amateur photographer -- he was a proofreader at The New York Evening Telegram -- but his avocation made him \"de facto the official photographer of baseball,\" one whose visions of the sport were seen annually for decades in Baseball magazine, the annual baseball guides, The Sporting News and baseball textbooks. Conlon once reminisced, \"The fun I have had, the days in the open, the associations, the confidences I have enjoyed -- well, you can't buy those things.\" The 205 shots Constance McCabe, a photography conservator, has chosen from the 8,000 surviving Conlon negatives convey the eternally fresh wonder a spectator might feel at being in the open air alongside John McGraw squatting by third base, or watching Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig warm up on the sidelines. Thanks to excellent production, and a brilliant job of design by Carol Robson, great names from the recesses of baseball antiquity come vividly to life, from Honus Wagner, Napoleon Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, Frank Chance and Walter Johnson to Grover Cleveland Alexander, Jimmie Foxx, Rogers Hornsby and Tris Speaker. Ms. McCabe's brother, Neal, brought his lifelong enthusiasm for baseball to his research on Conlon and his subjects; the text offers delightful nuggets of information about the innumerable firsts that Conlon recorded: the first American League umpire, the first batter in the World Series, the first photo on a baseball bubble-gum card. \"Baseball's Golden Age\" is equally enthralling in image and word and amply illustrates the timeless fascination of the field of dreams.

Giuliani spent last week demonstrating that he wanted to take control of the city's school system and shake up 110 Livingston Street, its base in Brooklyn.   On Monday, he named Edward N.

He spent the next few days castigating Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines for his failure to make the staff cuts that Mr. Giuliani wanted.

As we have a principal of separation of church and state, school policy makers shoud promote the separation of fact from fiction. Hats don't affect S.A.T.'s.

The signs of battle can elude the untutored eye: an activity sheet here; a table of beans, buttons, geometric blocks and other math manipulatives there. And the lines of battle can deceive: they have shifted with the latest findings on early childhood development and assessments of the quality of American education.    Even the goals have changed as Americans have redefined the role of school: To prepare children for the rites and rigors of academe? To teach them social skills? To Americanize and educate immigrant children quickly and well?    Always at the heart of the dispute, however, is the questions of how children learn best and, knowing that, how best to teach them, says Liliam G. Katz, a professor of early childhood education at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. \"Debate over the answer,\" she added, \"has raged back and forth like a pendulum for the last 100 years.\"    Where once the various sides squared off over curriculum issues of \"play\" or \"activities\" versus \"academics,\" and \"open\" as against \"structured\" classrooms, today the debate often pits the \"child-centered\" approach against the \"teacher-centered\" one.    \"In its pure form, the child-centered approach says that if you provide the right environment -- different activity areas, concrete objects to manipulate -- and let children loose in it, things will happen,\" said Professor Katz, who is president of the Washington-based National Association for Education of Young Children, the nation's largest professional association of early childhood educators. The teacher-centered approach, very simply put, has the teacher pouring knowledge into children; youngsters learn skills -- often through drills and practice -- determined by the teacher and the school. A Trend to Commercial Curriculums    The few national studies on the subject show that both approaches can be found in kindergartens throughout the country. But researchers suggest a trend toward using commercially prepared curriculums that focus on narrowly defined academic skills, like letter recognition and counting. And a drumbeat of voices is increasingly warning, sometimes with a religious fervor, that these curriculums are too tough and will lead more and more youngsters to fail.    Now a truce is being forged: Whatever teachers teach and however they teach it, their approach should be developmentally appropriate.    \"We mean that while we shouldn't teach beyond what a kid is capable of knowing and learning, we shouldn't teach below what he is capable of knowing and learning either,\" said Bernard Spodek, a professor of early childhood development at the University of Illinois. \"The idea is to see what a child is capable of and then try to extend and challenge that without frustrating him.\"    The aim, researchers and educators agree, is to instill in kindergarteners a desire to learn. And they should actually learn something, too; their intellectual abilities and problem-solving skills should be enhanced.    That kindergarten has changed was inevitable, if only because kindergarteners themselves have changed. Most are veterans of day care, nursery school or some other preschool arrangement. They are also full-fledged members of the television generation.    \"Kindergarten may no longer be where all these children learn their colors or to count,\" said Rebecca S. New, an associate professor of education and coordinator of the graduate program in early childhood education at the University of New Hampshire in Durham.    Indeed, with television, movies and computers, educational toys and electronic games, knowledge that was once esoteric is now commonplace. As a result, parents and teachers often expect more academically of the kindergarten crowd, although for many youngsters day care may have constituted poor-quality baby-sitting in an uninviting place.    The demand for a more academic, \"back to basics\" kingergarten accelerated in the 1980's, especially in the wake of \"A Nation at Risk,\" a 1983 Federal commission report suggesting that many children in the United States were failing to achieve in school. In a \"push-down\" effect, the pressure was on to give American students an earlier, some thought better start, and teach in kindergarten the math and reading skills once taught in first grade.    Recently, other pro-academic forces have come into play. There are, for example, first-grade teachers who refuse to accept kindergarten graduates ill prepared for the basic-skills tests that elementary-school children are increasingly taking. And there are kindergarten teachers who are certified for grades K though 6, 8 or 9 and teach kindergarten as they would fourth grade.    Professor New noted that society's success norms had risen. \"It's not enough to graduate from high school,\" she said. \"You must attend college. Parents, particularly minority or immigrant parents, acting as advocates for their children thus want schools to put youngsters in a competitive position. Pushing Children Prematurely?    The backlash took its time, but in the late 1980's books such as David Elkind's \"The Hurried Child\" appeared, suggesting that children were being pushed prematurely to act like adults in all aspects of life. At the same time, early childhood development experts, who had focused on day care, awoke to the increase in kindergarten attendance. In 1965 only 59.5 percent of 5-year-olds were enrolled in kindergarten, according to the National Center for Education Statistics; by 1992 the figure exceeded 80 percent.    The researchers started pushing their findings into the public's domain. \"All the literature said that young children learn best when they are interested in something, when it relates to their lives, when it offers a cognitive conflict -- that is, there is no easy answer, so they may need help and must work with others,\" said Professor New.    The response in some kindergartens has been a rejection of academics in favor of a kindergarten 50's-style, in which socialization skills are emphasized, friendships are made and children are cradled in a nurturing atmosphere.    Such a regimen functions almost as an extension of day care, teaching children to operate in a group, away from home and under the care and authority of someone other than their parents. Youngsters are also socialized to the culture of school: arriving on time, following instructions and being quiet for some small part of a regulated day.    But just as the contemporary, academic kindergarten may set cognitive goals few 5 year-olds can attain, the retro-classic kindergarten may ignore children's cognitive development entirely.    \"Learning is messy,\" said Yvonne Smith, a kindergarten teacher at Central Park East Elementary School on East 106th Street in Manhattan. With a master's degree in early childhood education and 20 years of teaching experience, Ms. Smith should know.    \"Lots of lessons are imbedded in a single subject or activity,\" she explained. \"We're looking at animals, for example. There is vocabulary describing the animals, books about animals, the sorting of animals by color and shape, type and size. There are paintings to be made of animals and stories to write and recite about them. There is even measuring, especially since one child wanted to know how long it took a giraffe to swallow with such a long neck.\" An Impression of Organized Chaos    Organized chaos is what a visitor sees in this class of 25, with small groups of children intently clustered in different activity areas around the room, like the dry sand table, the writing table and the cooking corner. There is a library and a listening area with tapes, and Huggy, the class guinea pig.    The children choose where they will work at the start of the day, their choices written for all to see. Labels abound in this room, indicating with a name, a drawing, a numeral, gingerbread-type figures and a spelled-out number the nature of each activity area and how many children can work there.    \"Children must assemble and disassemble, interact with other children and adults to figure out how the world works,\" Ms. Smith explained. \"They must do it in a setting that takes care of and develops each child, physically, socially, emotionally and cognitively.\"    But they are not free to roam. Through the pockets of quiet concentration and the hubbub of discovery, there is Ms. Smith, watching and guiding; suggesting to one youngster that she has the makings of the color brown on her palette of many hues; listening to another child spin a tale from single letters on a page. \"But clearly, she knows that each letter stands for a word,\" Ms. Smith said.    Is learning going on here? \"My son, Bryant, entered this class barely speaking English,\" said Mei Siu, who came to the United States from Hong Kong 10 years ago. \"Now he speaks it well. Sometimes he reads to me: he can't read the words, but he can tell me the story. More important, he is independent, confident in himself. I know of relatives whose children are in stricter, more traditional classes, but they haven't learned as much as my son.\"   Across town at Public School 163 on West 97th Street, an airy orderliness characterizes Ilene Golembiovsky's kindergarten class of 24. There are fewer activity areas here, and everything from blocks to books is more neatly stored. But on a dreary day this room is awash with artwork and names on the wall, and alive with children, seated on the floor eagerly counting out a classmate's six years.    It's Joshua's birthday, as the sign he proudly wears around his neck said. \"I am 6 six years old today.\"    \"And one for good luck,\" Mrs. Golembiovsky said. \"Six plus one is . . .\"    \"Seven,\" the class shouted.   \"Good,\" said the teacher in the first of many encouraging words for the day.    In this class the teacher, with a master's degree in early childhood education and almost 29 years of experience, calls many of the tunes, determining the activities and imparting knowledge. But her nurturing nature is unmistakable -- \"I make sure to tell them when I make a mistake so they know it's no big deal,\" she said -- and the children willingly go along.    \"Socialization is most important here,\" she said. \"Working together, sharing. We all have classroom jobs, so that we all learn to be both responsible and independent.\"    But, she added, \"many of my parents really care about academics, learning to read, learning to count, pushing ahead, pushing ahead, pushing ahead.\"   Workbooks are used, as is a phonics-alphabet chant. \"They are what parents want these days, and surprisingly, the children love it because it's what the big kids do,\" Mrs. Golembiovsky said, adding that the youngsters proudly point to finished pages as an accomplishment. She considers the materials \"supplemental, reinforcement for other things we do in class.\"   On this day there is also a project on shoes, with youngsters deciding who is wearing shoes -- as against boots or sneakers -- and how many there are of each color and what size, as they trace their footwear on paper, which they label with their names and will post for all to see.   Is learning going on here? \"My son Stephen didn't want to go to school,\" said his mother, Virginia Adams. \"Now even when he's sick, he wants to go. He had playtime in day care. Here, he's learned to write his name; he excitedly points to words and spells them out.\"    The lesson here is clear, said Deborah Stipek, a professor at the Graduate School of Education of the University of California at Los Angeles, who has studied the effects of both kinds of kindergartens on students.   First, most kindergartens offer some combination of child-initiated and teacher-directed, or at least teacher-guided, activities.    Second, people should not judge an activity by whether it is in some category, but rather by whether it is appropriate for particular children in a particular place.    In kindergartens of Spanish-speaking youngsters, for example, Claude Goldenberg, the associate director of the urban education studies center at U.C.L.A.'s Graduate School of Education, found \"unambiguously academic\" classes that emphasized drills and workbooks successfully teaching 5-year-olds the basics of reading and literacy development.    \"To my surprise, these kids were learning,\" Professor Goldenberg said. \"And they weren't just testing well. I talked to them and their parents; these kids couldn't wait to show me how they could read; they loved school.\"   Even Professor Stipek's yet-unpublished research suggests that teacher-directed activities using drill and practice, worksheets and group instruction may teach some children important skills. \"What is important about any activity or teaching approach is that the child show enthusiasm and interest in what's happening in class,\" she said, \"that the child take pride in his or her accomplishment, and that the child learns something from it.\"  Cautionary Tales of the Extremes    Cautionary tales abound about kindergartens at the extremes. Virtually all the researchers and teachers interviewed said they knew of or had seen \"sit down, shut up, count to 10\" classes in which teachers had little time, and no patience, for children who deviated from a curriculum of activity sheets, drill and practice, requiring children to sit at desks or tables for long periods.    Several educators also spoke of observing \"anything goes\" classrooms in which teachers rarely intervened. Some youngsters were overwhelmed into inaction by the choices available to them, or bored because no one was guiding and extending their activities. Many simply cruised from activity to activity, turning what should have been a journey of self-discovery into an exercise in self-indulgence.   What can parents do to steer a healthy course for their children?    The answer, educators agree, is to see for yourself. Parents should arrange to visit the kindergarten classroom and observe. Begin by determining if your child enjoys school.   Professor Stipek cautioned, however, that \"What looks like play to parents can be serious learning to kids. Ask the teacher why the children are making muffins or counting buttons.\"    A good teacher, she said, should be able to tell you the goal or purpose of an activity. She should be able to assess whether each child is achieving that goal, and should adjust the activity accordingly.   Ms. Smith said that \"parents have to trust a school and their child's teacher. If they are uncomfortable with the teaching philosophy and approach, then they can never work in partnership with the teacher in their child's interest. Their child will never get the support he or she needs to learn.\"   Her advice in such cases? \"Take your child out of that class and find a kindergarten where both you and your youngster are happy.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19940410","headline":"It's Time to Change, a Planning Study Says","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/nyregion/its-time-to-change-a-planning-study-says.html","abstract":"A REPORT to taxpayers released Wednesday by County Executive Andrew P.

The situation, however, is decidedly out of the ordinary, because the pupils in the well-appointed mobile home classroom are the juvenile stars of the popular television comdey series \"Home Improvement.\"    \"Do we have to do school now?\" whines Zachery Ty Bryan, 12 years old, who portrays Brad, the eldest son. \"I don't want to do these stupid lessons.\" Steve Elster ignores Zachery's lament and plunges into a lecture on how amino acids contribute to hereditary cell defects. As a studio teacher, Mr. Elster is one of a cadre of professional hybrids on whom children like Zachery depend. In order to do their jobs well, Mr. Elster and his co-teacher, Daphne Boelsma, must be by turns tutors, friends, therapists, protectors and surrogate parents for their young charges.   While California minors toil making commercials, acting in television shows or movies, those who haven't graduated from high school must go to school three hours a day, 15 hours a week. Although all states require a minimum number of hours of instruction for children working in the entertainment industry, only California law specified that even when a child's educational needs have been met, a state-certified studio teacher must be present on the set, serving as guardian of his or her health and safety, even during summer vacations.    With children so prevalent in movies and television the last few years, studio teachers have not been faced with the intermittent unemployment that plagued them in the past. Hired by production companies from a roster maintained by the teachers' union, they earn more than public school employees when they do work -- though considerably less than their students do.    Children who work have to be registered in accredited school, and the curriculum covered by their studio teacher is determined by their school of record. Students with continuing jobs, such as roles on television series, sometimes don't actually visit the schools at which they are nominally enrolled; they are often in independent study programs, which were developed for pregnant students trying to keep up with their lessons while out of school. Rare Visits to 'Regular School'    Zachery, a sixth grader, and his two television brothers call their home schools \"regular school,\" an apt term since studio schooling is predictably irregular. Some children study with a studio teacher only a few days a year while appearing in commercials, while others spend several months making a movie or miniseries. And since many situation comedies schedule a break one week each month, the youngsters in their casts can return to their home schools periodically.    Jonathan Taylor Thomas, 12, a sixth grader who plays Randy, the middle son in 'Home Improvement,\" says: \"A lot of kids at my regular school don't understand. They go, 'Oh, you're so lucky. You don't have to go to school.' It's not like that. We do the same exact work that the public schools do, but sometimes it's more difficult because we have to do it in a shorter amount of time.\"    Studio teachers maintain contact with their students' home-school teachers, getting copies of texts used and tests given. In many cases, they fax or mail work done on the set to the classroom teacher. For a junior high or high school student, they will keep track of work assigned by as many as six different teachers.    The goal of most studio teachers is to keep students academically up to grade level and personally down to earth. Mr. Elster's dry sense of humor surfaces when his pubescent scholars sound inappropriately mature. \"I like being on this show because I know I have a steady job,\" 12-year-old Jonathan tells a visitor. \"Right,\" Mr. Elster adds. \"He has the ex-wives, the alimony, the mortgage to worry about.\"    How well studio schooling works depends on how important education is to the parents involved. Parents who value learning communicate that ethic to their children, who work hard in school even while they're busy acting. Conversely, the unmotivated student typically comes from a family more interested in a child's earning potential than in his acquisition of knowledge.    Arlene Singer-Gross has been a studio teacher for 15 years, 8 of them on the long-running comedy \"Who's the Boss?\" \"I've worked with parents whose priority was, 'How come my child didn't get a close-up and the other child did?' rather than 'Can she read?\"' said Ms. Singer-Gross.    She briefly taught a 16-year-old whose parents considered education a necessary evil. They were eager for the boy to take his high school proficiency exam so he could work longer hours as an actor. \"He had gotten the message,\" Ms. Singer-Gross said. \"It wasn't like he wanted to do homework; he wanted to do his publicity photos. I felt in that situation, my job was to teach him life skills. I taught him how to write a check, how to balance a checkbook.\"    By law, California studio teachers may work with a maximum of 10 students, but the student-teacher ratio is usually one or two to one. As in Ms. Singer-Gross's experience, opportunities to tailor programs to a student's needs are abundant. \"I can take a child in the seventh grade and have him reading Shakespeare, if he's that advanced,\" she says. \"Or if a child is having a hard time with the multiplication tables, I can work on that for three days, design an approach just for him, or turn the math lesson into a game.\"    Actors and actresses are the beneficiaries of the societal assumption that because a person is attractive and personable, he or she is bright. \"I've taught some wonderful, sweet kids who were great when it was time for them to do their scenes, but they were struggling in school,\" says Laura Gary, a studio teacher who went on location when the movie \"Free Willy\" was filmed, and is currently working on \"Full House,\" one of the television comedies that started the trend to family shows with young cast members. She enjoys being able to explain and drill until a subject is mastered, without worrying about boring the faster learners that inhabit a large, heterogeneous classroom.    Zachery of \"Home Improvement\" says, \"You get a lot more accomplished on the set because it's one on one with the teacher, not one on thirty. The teacher doesn't have to wonder about me not understanding something, because if I don't I'll just tell her. If I get it right away, we can just go on to the next thing.\"    Studio teachers are as aware of a student's moods as his academic strengths and weaknesses. Although one of the professional child's survival skills is adaptability, the actor who goes directly from performing a very emotional scene to grappling with geometric proofs might not have an easy time making the switch. \"When they come into the schoolroom from the set, I try to give them a cooling-off period,\" Ms. Singer-Gross says. \"I might encourage them to talk about the experience they went through and how they internalized it, or instead of doing math, which takes more concentration, I give them an assignment to read for a while, so they can calm themselves down.\"    When she isn't making a movie like \"The Addams Family\" or its sequel, 14-year-old Christina Ricci attends a suburban public school in New Jersey. For the four months she will work on the upcoming film \"Casper\" (about the friendly ghost), school is a one-room trailer that she has adorned with a Red Hot Chili Peppers poster, berthed on the Universal Studios lot. Although there are desks in the trailer, Christina can lie on the floor, pop a tape into her cassette player and drink a soda while she completes her assignments. \"Here I call my teacher Rhona,\" she said. \"In regular school, it would be Ms. Gordon.\" That reflects the rapport and trust that frequently, and rewardingly, develop between student and studio teacher.    Like the private tutors once engaged for children of privileged class, studio teachers, by virtue of the intimacy and variety of situations they share with their students, inevitably impart more than the basics. When a teacher and student eat dinner together on location, a number of teachers say they can't help but notice a child's table manners and would be inclined to correct them if the need were obvious.    Everyone expects that addition, subtraction and the causes of the Civil War will be covered in school. But questions of values that may not arise in regular classrooms are inescapable in an environment that is part school, part glamorous workplace.    \"There is no other business that tolerates the kind of behavior you see in this one -- spoiled, demanding behavior,\" Ms. Gordon says. \"It happens with adults, teen-agers and young children. I've worked with children who were supporting their families and the balance of power was off. It got to be, like, who's running the store here? The kid was used to controlling everybody, and I felt it was up to me to teach him to treat adults with respect, because no one else had done it.\"    But while it is inevitable for studio teachers to take on a variety of roles in their students' lives, including buddy and confidant, often what a young person really wants in a friend is someone the same age with the same interests, fears and curiosities.    Lecy Goranson portrayed the eldest daughter on the top-rated television show \"Roseanne\" from age 13 to 18, and during that time, she said, she craved friends in her own age group. Ms. Goranson attended Vassar her freshman year, and at 19 is currently taking night classes at the University of California at Los Angeles. \"When I went to college,\" she said, \"I was better prepared in some ways than my peers, because I was always around adults on 'Roseanne,' and that was a very advanced learning experience.\"    \"But I think I missed out being isolated,\" she continued. \"Even though my TV sister, Sara Gilbert, is really smart, there were still just the two of us in a little room. There was no recess, no walking from one class to the next where you would see other kids. You don't learn just from books or from your teacher. You learn from other students, too, from hearing what they have to say. When I think about having sat in the same room for hours and hours every day for five years -- the closest parallel I can draw is a prison.\"    The 7-year-old stars of \"Full House,\" Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen, \"do school\" in a blue-carpeted second floor schoolroom inside a Burbank sound stage that is windowless, but hardly prison-like. The saucer-eyed twins (identical except for temporarily differing patters of baby tooth loss) sit on the flowered cushion of a white wicker loveseat taking turns ready a picture book, \"Josefina Finds the Prince,\" aloud with their teacher, Ms. Gary. A rehearsal for \"Full House\" is going on directly below, on the permanent set for Uncle Jesse's attic apartment. Growing Up on 'Full House'    The twins have shared the pivotal role of Michelle since they were nine months old. They have thus virtually grown up on \"Full House,\" and their parents, acting coach and teachers have made special efforts to infuse the twins' lives with elements of normalcy, including ballet classes for Ashley and riding lessons for her sister. The show films on a four-day workweek, so the girls attend separate second-grade classes at a private school on Mondays and every fourth week, when the show is on hiatus. To eace the transition between the two school settings, Ms. Gary has deliverately made herself less available in her classroom, prohibiting questions from her two students in the middle of a test, for example.    The attempt to foster autonomy makes sense, but it seems to be an uphill battle. When Ms. Gary previews a nutrition test that will have to be completed and sent to their school (\"Which picture shows a balanced meal?\"), the girls, natural cuddlers, get up from their Lilliputian desks and each cling to one of her arms as they study the material.    Independence, manners, spelling, a sense of persective about show business and single-cell reproduction -- if children in studio school learn all their lessons, they have the chance to avoid what every child dreads, being different. \"I've met kids in this business who have never been around kids their own age and they don't know how to relate to them,\" Christina Ricci says. \"It's weird.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19940410","headline":"POSTINGS: $10 Million Gift; Columbia's Audubon Center Is Picking Up Momentum","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/realestate/postings-10-million-gift-columbia-s-audubon-center-is-picking-up-momentum.html","abstract":"  Thanks to a $10 million gift, construction can begin later this year on the second building of the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park in Washington Heights, Columbia University officials said last week.

I was warned about this from the beginning, warned that love and loyalty wouldn't help once I attempted a nonfiction account of a year at Kenyon College, my alma mater, my current employer. It was a no-win proposition, a kamikaze flight, an untenured professor's invitation to his own career suicide. And an irresistible idea.\n\n How many books have attempted to capture the deep traditions, the insular tensions, the seasonal wars that characterize life at a small American liberal arts college? Who has bothered to record the compromises and betrayals, the wonderful mix of seriousness and silliness? Jarrell, Lurie, McCarthy, Malamud, Malone -- I could name a handful of books, not enough for even the skimpiest syllabus -- and they focused on personal issues and decaying marriages more than on the life of the institution. All those readers, yet so few writers. Something seemed to get in their way.\n\n I spent a full year at Kenyon, in Gambier, Ohio, putting myself in the way of as much experience as possible. I lived in the same freshman dorm I'd occupied 30 years before, lectured and graded, sometimes exhilarated, sometimes in despair. Kenyon had its good and bad days and so did I. I followed firing searches, faculty debates, alumni complaints, admissions meetings.\n\n The book that resulted, \"Alma Mater: A College Homecoming,\" was mixed. How could it be otherwise? You could find evidence in it that Kenyon College was a good, occasionally excellent place, with a prudent administration, able faculty, lively student body. A place worth defending. But that wasn't the whole truth. Some other passages discovered a thin-skinned place, complacent, fractious and adrift, in need of shaping up.\n\n I tried to tell the truth and I tried to be fair, to pick, if not pull, my punches. In the end , it would have been easy to write a book that was harsher and it would have been hard to write a book that was gentler. But that was my opinion. There were other opinions, as I discovered when I came back to campus in January.\n\n I've always enjoyed returning, as a teacher, to the college where I once was taught. And little Gambier is wonderful even at its bleakest, at the start of second semester, sullen and ominous, a time of salt-stained streets and slushy lawns, gray hillsides and May a light-year away. Perched on an Ohio hilltop, surrounded by farms and scraps of forest, brushed by a river spanned by rusting railroad trestles, Kenyon is the very image of a small residential college, a perfect intersection of thought and growth and haunting memory. But this year I came back worried, like a teen-ager creeping home late at night, parking a just-dented family car in the garage, tiptoeing upstairs and waiting for hard questions -- or pained silences -- at the breakfast table.\n\n My absence during first semester had spared me the college's immediate reaction to \"Alma Mater,\" which appeared in late November. The student newspaper interviewed Kenyon's president, whose public response was polite, if strained: \"The critical temper is not surprising since there must be shadows and bright spots to make the book plausible.\" The dean of admissions declared the book \"incomplete or not well rounded\" and a student who \"forked over the equivalent of three 10-inch sausage, pineapple and cheddar cheese pizzas\" to buy my book pronounced herself well satisfied. In early December, hundreds of students and faculty packed into Philomathesian Hall, a dark wood lecture hall with stained glass windows, for a campus-wide forum on my book. The meeting seems to have been a mix of damage control, celebration, group therapy and in-absentia trial.\n'Brutal but Honest'\n\nLater, listening to a bootleg tape, blurry and indistinct, I feel as if I'm eavesdropping on a jury room. I am criticized, I am generously defended. I am \"brutal but honest,\" one voice declares, I am Kenyon's \"somewhat disappointed lover,\" said another. Somebody -- could my ears be deceiving me? -- compares me to J. D. Salinger. Others, no doubt, are picturing Benedict Arnold.\n\n Soon after, reports started coming in from outside: concern among Kenyon parents, prospective donors up in arms, irate alumni sniffing treason. \"Are we going to rescind the s.o.b.'s degree?\" one old-timer inquired.\n\n The wisest decision, I supposed, would have been not to return at all. That's the writer's usual pattern. You research and report, you immerse yourself, indiscriminately, because anything might be material. Then you withdraw to write. And when that's over your withdrawal becomes escape, even if it's only to another book. But I returned to Gambier to witness the consequences of my writing, the judgement of my judgements, my work worked over.\n\n \"I'm surprised they let you back in town,\" joked a college security officer when he saw me on my first night back. \"Are you working on your resume?\" inquired a former student. \"Have you seen the president yet?\" \"Have you talked to the president's wife?\" Those questions set the pattern, a probing, almost prurient interest that was less about the book than about its impact on the college, on applications and admissions, on other people. The issue wasn't whether the book was good, but whether it was good -- or bad -- for Kenyon and for me.\n\n The impact of the book is, as they like to say at colleges, problematic, The college goes about its work, confronting lower enrollments, staff reductions, budget cutbacks, increased concern about the cost of liberal arts education and skepticism about its benefits. It's a time of austerity, anxiety and anger. \"The future will resemble the present... or worse,\" Kenyon's president warned a faculty meeting just the other day.\n\n All of this suggests that here or elsewhere there'll be plenty of material for other books on college life, and so I offer some advice to other writers who enter this green, cloistered arena.\n\n Think carefully about whether to tell them what you're up to. How deliciously tempting it was to consider writing \"Alma Mater\" on the sly. I knew from other years at Kenyon the richness of the material that would come to me, unsought. Every secret is meant to be told, sooner or later. At a small campus, you don't have to wait so long. But I decided it wouldn't be fair to ambush Kenyon. I announced my intentions and lived with the substantial costs.\n\n Some people turned sullen, or skeptical, or strenously -- unquotably -- polite. With others, the opposite happened, and I confronted those statements that hang in the air like ballooned utterances over the heads of cartoon characters, statements begging \"quote me! quote me!\" And then there were those tenured professors, their jobs protected in the name of free speech, who nonetheless specified that they were going \"off the record\" or \"not for attribution,\" as if we were trading Oval Office secrets in a Washington parking garage.\n\n Realize that not everyone will admire your work. It wasn't just what I said about, say, spousal hiring or grade inflation. My opinions could be discounted as an old grad's nostalgia, or the meanderings of a part-time hire, or the glibness of a journalist out of his depth. But what about the people I quoted and the things they said about each other? Reporting old battles, I threatened to start new ones. And what about the people I never mentioned at all? Wouldn't they be hurt the most? And then there were alumni who wanted only the best for their alma mater, and that meant reading only the best. And Kenyon parents, paying more than $20,000 per year to educate their kids, didn't want their investment devalued. I didn't mean to dash their hopes, but somebody had to tell them that quality is a sometime thing, even at good schools, that we produce wonderful graduates and amazing goof-offs and that I didn't mean for them to think less of Kenyon but to think more about it.\n\nAcknowledge that trying to be fair about academe is like building a house on an earthquake fault. Every college is a network of factions and fissures, tremors and spasms, shallow and deep. We have people who are delighted to teach and read and others who stress research; some who'd love to stay here forever, others chafing to move on. There are easy graders and there are martinets, professors who aim to humanize the B students of the world -- since they're the ones who end up running it -- and professors who measure success by the number of A students who get into graduate schools and try, against cruel odds, to become professors.\n\nSome professors are content with the student body -- mostly middle class or upper, mostly white -- that finds its way here and pays to come. Others press for diversity, change and outreach. Some of my colleagues believe that the continued existence of fraternities at Kenyon is a moral and intellectual affront. Others say that people who find themselves in the middle of rural Ohio have a right to form groups, give parties and do foolish things occasionally.\nA Diverse Group\n\n The student body includes superlative kids who struggle for still-elusive A grades and others who settle cheerfully for the ubiquitous B. (No one puts up with C's; these are life-destroying insults.) We have students for whom Kenyon is magic, a life-enhancing experience, and others for whom it's a slapdash passage from summer camp to country club. We have students who love to write, and others who hate to read. I tried to find room for all of them in my book.\n\nBut equity had its cost. To some it was a cop-out, sterile and timid. People wanted to see other people gotten -- wanted me to see things their way, fire broadsides where they had only sniped, cut my throat where they swallowed their tongues. Get those fraternity drunks, those whining feminists, those crusty political scientists, those radical-chic historians, that suave, smooth-talking president, that dithering provost. But I used thumb tacks in a place that wanted nails. \n\nIn the end, though, it was worth it. People's welcoming reactions -- not that they agreed with every point -- overwhelmed the hostile. There were letters from today's students and those of 30 years ago. This from a student I don't know, studying overseas this year: \"What happens at Kenyon occurs everywhere but is magnified 100 times at a community-oriented institution because every action is taken personally. I hope that I will see you around next year but, if not, good book.\" Another student said, \"You captured the Kenyon I love, and the Kenyon I know, and the Kenyon I want the college to become.\" \n\nI've heard from teachers and administrators, some still here, others who've moved on to other places and who look back at Kenyon, sometimes with hurt, sometimes affection, often both. Just lately there've been letters from people at other institutions who assure me that Kenyon's problems, and virtues, are not unique. Late afternoons and weekends, hiding in my office, I'm greeted by people who want to talk -- total strangers who drive to this small Ohio village to see the special place I wrote about.\nSense of Connection\n\n The best thing about writing about a real place -- and returning to face the consequences -- is the sense of connection between your work and your audience. Five books preceded \"Alma Mater,\" and the story was always the same: some reviews, modest sales, a rapid withdrawal from shelves where books last no longer than a cup of yogurt in a supermarket. Working on the next book, revving up energy and hopes for a new project, I've been haunted by the fate of my earlier efforts. \n\nThis time was different: the meetings, the talk, the body English, the hugs and stares, and glares, the letters and gossip, the 700 copies sold in the college bookstore and the first-time chance that, at least in this part of Ohio, a book of mine will outlive its author. Any book is an act of caring and a kind of tribute. It's a gift. It distinguishes its subject from all the unremarked places, the ones that never get written about at all. Maybe your college -- your parents -- will understand it. Maybe they won't. If not today, maybe tomorrow.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19940410","headline":"Prison Boot Camps Prove No Sure Cure","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/nyregion/prison-boot-camps-prove-no-sure-cure.html","abstract":"  No one complained at 5:45 this morning when a drill instructor shouted for another round of push-ups on the cold and wet pavement wriggling with worms that crawled from the newly thawed earth.

In 752 games, Bossy scored 573 goals, 76.2 percent. Bossy's career was filled with considerable physical abuse, close legitimate checking and a good deal of illegitimate punishment.

The English novelist Anthony Hope once wrote that \"good families are generally worse than any others,\" and my husband's family, a large, congenial group, is a very good family. Like most American families, it is diverse -- its numbers include artists and mortgage bankers, builders and businessmen, a geographer and an elephant trainer -- and, like most, it has no familial homestead. Its members are scattered across the points of the compass, as far west as Oklahoma and Texas and as far east as Japan. So early in 1993, Marjorie and Karl rolled out a map, push-pinned the location of family members in the United States, and picked a point roughly midway between: Tennessee. Then they set out from their home in Washington on a 1,200-mile pilgrimage in search of a park in that state that might satisfy the brood. They deliberately sidestepped any place near Nashville -- they wanted the family together for the whole weekend, not wandering off on side trips to the Grand Ole Opry. They settled on Fall Creek Falls, on the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau in eastern Tennessee, a 16,800-acre park that has an inn, cabins, tennis courts, an 18-hole championship golf course, horseback-riding, an Olympic pool, boating on a 350-acre lake stocked with largemouth bass, channel cat and bluegill, all surrounded by some spectacular natural scenery.\n\nAnother missive, and we were set for mid-August 1993; dozens of Ackermans, Winklers and Veecks would attend, from the painter in Chicago to the bench-press champion of Oklahoma City, and, of course, my husband, our 1-year-old daughter, Zoe, and me. As August neared, trepidation gave way to deep ambivalence. I love my husband's family.

The horn was blowing long and short, the call for police, and the conductor told me there was a homeless man smoking on the train. I found him and escorted him out of the car. But then I made a mistake, turning my back to the train as it started to move. The homeless man pushed me into it and then came after me -- all 6 feet, 3 inches and 200-plus pounds of him -- biting and kicking, and we wrestled all over the platform until some other officers arrived. Meanwhile some passengers were yelling, \"My God, he's beating that poor man,\" and the person they were yelling at was me!\n\nFor John Q. Public, the homeless and the panhandlers in the subways are an annoyance; for a transit cop, they are a tough, unpleasant, sometimes dangerous part of a sometimes thankless job.

The organization sponsors the award in conjunction with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19940410","headline":"Why West Is More Than West","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/arts/classical-view-why-west-is-more-than-west.html","abstract":"  IT IS HEARTENING TO SEE, BOUND AND PRINTED, a document as strong and committed as the national standards for arts education, a proposed national curriculum for kindergarten through high school, developed by a consortium of arts education associations. It was recently presented to Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley after seven months of revision and criticism, and was hailed by the chairmen of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, both of whom urged its adoption by communities.   Unfortunately, these standards for the study of dance, music, theater and the visual arts are so sweeping that they are probably impossible to put into practice, at least during the 15 percent of the school day the report envisions. But since their adoption is optional, it may be just as well that they are so grand. We will probably see only a watered-down version of these requirements in classrooms, as staffing, budgetary and political pressures force compromises.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940410","headline":"An Ageless Moliere Speaks to the Ages","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/theater/golden-ages-theater-an-ageless-moliere-speaks-to-the-ages.html","abstract":"  ANY AGE THAT PRODUCED Moliere would be a golden age of theater.

The calf's mother, an imposing and similarly mottled heifer, stood next to her recumbent offspring and after a few moments, perhaps of self-satisfaction, bent down and concernedly sniffed the steaming air around the calf. Convinced that it was indeed hers, the heifer began to lick away the amniotic fluid from the calf's coat.

I had been to Martinique 15 years ago, and remembered a long, empty, idyllic beach called Les Salines near the little town of Ste.-Anne, sleepy fishing villages on the east coast with oceanfront restaurants specializing in dishes like fricassee of crab, and a rainbow right out of Brigadoon that arched over the bay of Fort-de-France.

Most obvious is the building boom that has turned many neighborhoods into a maze of cavernous holes and tall yellow cranes. More profound, however, has been Berlin's opening to the world. For years, this city was a fortified island, protected, for better or worse, against the influences of the world that surrounded it. Now, with the wall gone and borders to the east open or nearly open, it is once again central Europe's most cosmopolitan center.   Some of the effects of this change are unpleasant. Poor refugees beg on the streets, crime has risen (although not nearly to American levels), and some sections of the city, like the area around Zoo Station, a main rail terminus, have become dirty and rundown. But at the same time, cultural life has exploded. Foreign influences are everywhere, and Berlin has shed much of the provincialism that reigned here during the cold war years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940410","headline":"Chinese Bed-and-Breakfast","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/travel/travel-advisory-home-stays-chinese-bed-and-breakfast.html","abstract":"  Bed-and-breakfast in Beijing and Shanghai form the centerpiece of a new tour to China, organized by American-International Home Stays.

TWO ROOFS. TWO major civic projects. Riverbank Park in New York and Yerba Buena Gardens in San Francisco have a lot in common. Both were conceived to placate communities that had been saddled with controversial buildings. Both have resulted in public spaces of high architectural caliber. And both could have gone further in developing the concept on which they literally rest: a roof can be the bottom of a building as well as the top.   Riverbank Park has gained notoriety as the smelly park, the one built atop an offshore waste treatment plant in the Hudson River. First proposed in 1969 as compensation for foisting this classic Not-In-My-Back-Yard project on nearby Harlem, the 28-acre park finally opened a year ago, after 24 years of bureaucratic wrangling. Despite the chemical whiffs that periodically assail the nostrils (the city's sanitation engineers say they are working to eliminate them), the place is a popular success. With its pools, gym, outdoor rink and running track, it may be the most lavish sportsplex in town.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940410","headline":"A la Carte; More Than Just a Mere Bakery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/nyregion/a-la-carte-more-than-just-a-mere-bakery.html","abstract":"  NOT all ethnic food on Long Island is in restaurants.

The fund relies almost completely on private support. There are plans to restore a 4-mile riverside path - initially using $1.3 million dollars inFederal financing - by turn of the century. Here is a lisst of other plans and accomplishments. 1. New playground, planned for 1995 or 1996, at a cost of $162,000. 2. Volunteers have relandscaped Tiemann Place Gardens, over the last year and a half. 3. Densely wooded spot, a natural habitat for birds, to be enhanced by creating food and water sources and improving footpaths to the area. 4. New playground to be built in 1995, at a cost of $150,000. 5. New equipment and benches installed four years ago, at a cost of $40,000. 6. The Fire Fighters Memorial resotred in 1991, at a cost of $2.1 million. 7. Relandscaping and erosion control around the Joan of Arc monument, at a cost of $50,000. 8. Relandscaping of Mount Tom, at a cost of $150,000 9. New sidwalks at the 83d Street playgound, which will also get water and gas lines to the comfort station and offices. 10. A program last summer directed the homeless inthe park to social services, at a cost of $150,000. A visitors center and restaurant are planned for the rotunda. 11. Reconstruction has been done of the seawall near the marina of the 79th Street boat basin. Dredging of the basin is incomplete. Public access to the marina is restricted to boat owners. 12. A $250,000 renovation of the Neufeld playground was completed in 1992. 13. Volunteers helped create a new ballfield at 72d Street in 1991, at a cost of $60,000. 14. An unused southbound entrrance ramp to the Miller Highway is being removed and the 72d Street entrance is being restored. A statue of Eleanor Roosevelt will be built at the entrance inthe next two years.

Singapore is probably the safest city in the world, although at the expense of many individual rights. \n\nSingapore is the lengthened shadow of Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled as Prime Minister for 31 years. He took the country from poverty to plenty in one generation (its per capita gross national product is higher than that of its erstwhile colonizer, England). Upon leaving office in 1990, he took the title of Senior Minister and remains enormously influential. He has also embarked on a career of sorts as a pundit, speaking his mind with impolitic frankness. In January, I interviewed him.\n\nQ. Do you view the United States as a model for other countries? \n\nA. I find attractive and unattractive features. I like the free, easy and open relations between people regardless of social status, ethnicity or religion. And the things I have always admired about America: the openness in argument about what is good or bad for society; the accountability of public officials, and the lack of secrecy and terror that are part and parcel of Communist government. \n\nBut as a total system, I find parts of it totally unacceptable: guns, drugs, violent crime, vagrancy, unbecoming behavior in public -- in sum, the breakdown of civil society. The expansion of the right of the individual to behave or misbehave as he pleases has come at the expense of orderly society. In the East, the main object is to have a well-ordered society so that everybody can have maximum enjoyment of his freedoms. This freedom can only exist in an ordered state and not in a natural state of contention and anarchy. \n\nLet me give you an example that encapsulates the whole difference between America and Singapore. America has a vicious drug problem. How does it solve it? It goes around the world helping other antinarcotic agencies to try and stop the suppliers. It pays for helicopters, defoliating agents and so on. And when it is provoked, it captures the President of Panama and brings him to trial in Florida. \n\nSingapore does not have that option. We can't go to Burma and capture warlords. What we can do is pass a law which says that any customs officer or policeman who sees anybody in Singapore behaving suspiciously, leading him to suspect the person is under the influence of drugs, can require that person to have his urine tested. If the sample is found to contain drugs, the man immediately goes for treatment. In America, if you did that it would be an invasion of the individual's rights and you would be sued.\n\nI was interested to read that Colin Powell, when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. military followed our approach because when a recruit signs up he agrees to be tested. Now, I would have thought this kind of approach would be quite an effective way to deal with the terrible drug problem you have. But the idea of the inviolability of the individual has been turned into dogma. And yet nobody minds when the Army captures the president of another state and puts him in jail. I find that incomprehensible. This approach will not solve America's drug problem. Whereas with Singapore's way, we may not solve it, but we will lessen it considerably, as we have done.\n\nQ. Would it be fair to say that you admired America more 25 years ago? What, in your view, went wrong?\n\nA. Yes, things have changed. I would hazard a guess that it has a lot to do with the erosion of the moral underpinnings of a society and the diminution of personal responsibility. The liberal, intellectual tradition that developed after World War II claimed that human beings had arrived at this perfect state where everybody would be better off if they were allowed to do their own thing and flourish. It has not worked out, and I doubt that it will. Certain basics about human nature do not change.\n\nMan needs a certain moral sense of right and wrong. There is such a thing called evil, and it is not the result of being a victim of society. You are just an evil man, prone to do evil things, and you have to be stopped from doing them. Westerners have abandoned an ethical basis for society, believing that all problems are solvable by a good government, which we in the East never believed possible.\n\nQ. Is such a fundamental shift in culture irreversible?\n\nA. No, it is a swing of the pendulum. I think it will swing back. I don't know how long it will take, but there's already a backlash in America against failed social policies that have resulted in people urinating in public, in aggressive begging in the streets, in social breakdown.\n\nQ. You say that your real concern is that this system not be foisted on other societies because it will not work there. Is there another viable model for political and economic development? Is there an \"Asian model\"?\n\nA. I don't think there is an Asian model as such. But Asian societies are unlike Western ones. The fundamental difference between Western concepts of society and government and East Asian concepts is that Eastern societies believe that the individual exists in the context of his family. He is not pristine and separate. The family is part of the extended family, and then friends and the wider society. The ruler or the government does not try to provide for a person what the family best provides. \n\nIn the West, especially after World War II, the governments came to be seen as so successful that they could fulfill all the obligations that in less modern societies are fulfilled by the family. This approach encouraged alternative families, single mothers for instance, believing that government could provide the support to make up for the absent father. \n\nThis is a bold, Huxleyan view of life but one from which I as an East Asian shy away. I would be afraid to experiment with it. I'm not sure what the consequences are, and I don't like the consequences that I see in the West. You will find this view widely shared in East Asia. \n\nIt's not that we don't have single mothers here. We are also caught in the same social problems of change when we educate our women and they become independent financially and no longer need to put up with unhappy marriages. But there is grave disquiet when we break away from tested norms, and the tested norm is the family unit. It is the building brick of society.\n\nGovernments will come, governments will go, but this endures. We start with self-reliance. In the West today it is the opposite. The government says give me a popular mandate and I will solve all society's problems.\n\nQ. What would you do instead to address America's problems?\n\nA. What would I do if I were an American? First, you must have order in society. Guns, drugs and violent crime all go together, threatening social order. Then the schools -- when you have violence in schools, you are not going to have education, so you've got to put that right. Then you have to educate rigorously and train a whole generation of skilled, intelligent, knowledgeable people who can be productive. \n\nI would start off with basics, working on the individual, looking at him within the context of his family, his friends, his society. But the Westerner says: \"I'll fix things at the top. One magic formula, one grand plan. I will wave a wand and everything will work out.\" It's an interesting theory but not a proven method.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940411","headline":"Review/Fashion; The Strident and the Serene","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/11/style/review-fashion-the-strident-and-the-serene.html","abstract":"  By the fourth day of the New York fashion shows for fall, with 11 runway shows scheduled, there was probably not a retailer or journalist who had not come up with some fantasy of making the rituals of fashion easier.

But where does that leave the 190-year-old society, which has teetered on the brink of disaster for years? Still in limbo. In fact, it may be more in limbo than ever. Last week Herbert S. Winokur Jr., a co-chairman of the society, the acting chief executive officer and a prime mover behind the New York University deal, abruptly resigned; the institution is now being run by staff committees under the eye of Wilbur L.
