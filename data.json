But of course we never think of Stravinsky as a Russian first and foremost; he was the arch-cosmopolitan, the modernist in perpetual exile, a principality unto himself. As Robert Craft, the composer's closest associate, has observed, he was a dandy, forever reinventing himself. He was also an imponderable legend; in the 1960's he was asked for an autograph by a man who turned out to be Frank Sinatra.   The Brooklyn program made a selection from Stravinsky's plurality of selves. Far more serious and cohesive than standard-issue thematic programming, the series drew on recent researches into the Russian national roots of Stravinsky's early radical period (1909-1917). The musicologist Richard Taruskin presented conclusions from his unpublished study \"Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions.\" And the Pokrovsky Ensemble of Moscow, a group that re-enacts peasant singing and dancing, demonstrated the folk sources of \"The Rite of Spring,\" \"Renard\" and \"Les Noces.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940510","headline":"Moscow Journal; Where Politicians Sometimes Tote Assault Rifles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/10/world/moscow-journal-where-politicians-sometimes-tote-assault-rifles.html","abstract":"  In the early morning on a not quite empty city street a week ago, two men fired at each other with Kalashnikov assault rifles in a shootout that left one of the gunmen, a reputed member of organized crime, dead.

Almost half a century has passed since he wrote criticism regularly -- he gave up his post as a reviewer for The Nation magazine in 1949 -- but he remains at once the most admired and excoriated writer on art, as much a touchstone of postwar American painting and sculpture as any of the painters and sculptors in whose circle he moved as an oracular presence.   Why is he still so potent a figure? The reasons are many; it is not simply that he backed the right horses, by identifying before others did the painter Jackson Pollock and the sculptor David Smith as the ones on which America should stake its claim to artistic primacy after the war. He did back them, strongly and effectively, and even at the risk of a certain critical inconsistency. He often repeated his suspicion of Surrealism and his dislike of art that he saw as violent and horrific, yet both Pollock and Smith were undeniably indebted to Surrealism. Greenberg chose to sidestep that fact (as he chose to praise the Surrealist Joan Miro by calling him a \"late Cubist\").","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940510","headline":"The Quirk of Quarks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/10/opinion/l-the-quirk-of-quarks-051993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Top Quark, Last Piece in Puzzle of Matter, Appears to Be in Place\" (front page, April 26):","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940510","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/10/nyregion/inside-045004.html","abstract":"  Rethinking Trade Strategy   The White House is wondering whether it is time for the United States to reconsider its trade strategy with Japan.

for the Bang on a Can Marathon at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday. Besides being the only piece in which cans were actually thwacked during the eight-and-a-half-hour program, its underlying philosophy has much in common with that of this eclectic new music series. When Cage composed this percussion quartet 53 years ago, he retained ties to the conventional music world and produced a fully notated score. Eventually, he would grant his interpreters considerable leeway.   But in 1941 he was breaking away from the mainstream in other ways. Advancing the notion that music can be wrung out of anything, he proposed an ensemble in which found objects augment a standard percussion battery. He also celebrated the primacy of rhythm. In \"Third Construction,\" melody is an illusion, suggested by the different pitches of the instruments, and harmony is frozen out entirely. And another of its elements -- its edgy, unflagging energy -- was ably conveyed by the Talujon Percussion Quartet.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"Books of The Times; One Disney Character's Real Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/11/books/books-of-the-times-one-disney-character-s-real-life.html","abstract":"  A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes  My Story  By Annette Funicello with Patricia Romanowski  Illustrated. 237 pages.

If the Devils, who lead the four-of-seven-game series, 3-2, can eliminate the Bruins from the Stanley Cup playoffs, they would have a date with the Rangers in the Eastern Conference finals starting on Sunday at Madison Square Garden. Should the Devils lose, Brodeur would guard the Devils' goal in Game 7 on Friday night at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, where he stopped all 22 shots the Bruins fired at him Monday night in New Jersey's 2-0 victory. Seeking an Edge    In these playoffs, coaches and players seek any kind of an edge. That is why Lemaire turned to a goalie tandem in the midst of a series. The coach's assumptions were that Brodeur, the 22-year-old rookie who had played well in nine straight games, might be somewhat worn and that Terreri would regard Boston Garden as an old friend.    The Bruins beat the Devils and Brodeur in the first two games here and then New Jersey won twice at Boston, with Terreri playing back-to-back games for the first time since March 12-13.    Terreri, from Warwick, R.I., said today that he was first taken to the Boston Garden at age 6 by his father for a Bruins game. He knows well the tight rink with little skating space behind the goal from having played there so often in five full seasons with the Devils and in Hockey East games while he played for Providence College.    \"Chris is confident,\" said Lemaire. \"And the players are confident in Chris.\"   Terreri dismisses the reality that his playing time all but disappeared in the last weeks of the regular season. He's flattered that his coach turned to him when the Devils went to Boston down 2-0. 'I'm Having Fun'    \"We were fighting for our lives,\" said Terreri. \"Of course, you want to play. But you respect what he says.    \"I'm thrilled I got a chance to help in the playoffs, that I've got a chance to win this series. It's a team game and I'm having fun.\"   Terreri added that he is as comfortable as he can be for Game 6 and that his teammates want to end the series Wednesday night.   \"Nobody wants to come back here Friday,\" said Terrari.   And nobody is mentioning the Rangers, just yet.    Lemaire's intentions with his two goaltenders in this series were always apparent to Terreri, who approved of them. \"It gives this team another dimension,\" Terreri said. Defensive Gem    According to Lemaire, the Devils played \"probably our best game defensively\" on Monday night.   The teams played evenly with swift up-and-down movement through the first period. After the first goal, by Corey Millen at 1 minute 23 seconds of the second period, Lemaire said: \"There was a difference. At that moment we started to take charge. I could feel it on the bench.\"   With 22 seconds remaining in the period, Bobby Carpenter and Claude Lemieux caught the Bruins on a 2-on-1 break. Lemieux passed the puck to Carpenter, who shot it from near the top of the right circle over Boston goaltender Jon Casey's glove.   The Devils tied up the Bruins at center ice much of the time and Adam Oates, Boston's great set-up man, all but disappeared. The Boston version, as expressed by Coach Brian Sutter, was that the Bruins stood around too much and stopped skating.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/11/style/chronicle-064041.html","abstract":"  ELIZABETH DE CROY, the Princess of Solre, a descendant of Hungarian kings from the Holy Roman Empire, has a mission that has occupied her for almost 25 years.

It takes an optimistic nature to believe his administration can raise the city bureaucracy's productivity enough to sustain services while reducing the number of employees. But, as the Mayor points out, he has already accomplished some things his critics claimed could not be done. Most notably, he has persuaded unions to accept a severance plan for city employees and to give him extraordinary authority to transfer employees between agencies.   The budget Mr. Giuliani submitted to the City Council yesterday was his formal plan for fiscal 1995, starting July 1. He faced an awesome $2.3 billion deficit -- the largest since the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's. And closing the gap is made more difficult by the public's rebellion against further tax increases. In contrast to predecessors who raised taxes, the Mayor opts to cut them -- only $35 million next year, but $260 million the year after, and more after that. He includes long-overdue relief for apartment owners, who pay higher taxes than owners of houses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"Civic Duty Calls.

He has vetoed the contract and wants to have his Labor Commissioner take the lead in negotiations.   This is a complicated issue, raised to a high emotional pitch by the recent budget battle that pitted the Mayor and the Chancellor against each other in a bruising public confrontation. In that battle, we stood squarely behind the Chancellor in his efforts to repel the Mayor's unwarranted intervention. But the school custodians are a special case; they run a system that has long defied rational control.

But after winning his comeback tournament on hard courts in Scottsdale, Ariz., in February and reaching the final of the Lipton championships in Key Biscayne, Fla., in March, Agassi has struggled on clay in Europe. He lost in the first round of the Monte Carlo Open last month. In an earlier match yesterday, No. 5 Michael Chang lost, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), to Jacco Eltingh of the Netherlands. Top-seeded Pete Sampras did not have such problems, however, reaching the round of 16.
