The group -- Mr. Baron on drums, Steve Swell on trombone and Ellery Eskalin on tenor saxophone -- played music that at times seemed to be coming through a stereo operating on half its channels. At other times Mr. Baron tried to sound like a band, full and complete. And since there isn't much literature for this instrumentation, Mr. Baron was referential, drawing on jazz and soul and funk.   It's an old conceit, to be catholic in one's sources, but Mr. Baron pulled it off, in part because he's so gifted a drummer. He would spell out ideas with just a ride cymbal, or use his hands quietly on the skins of the drums, or tap out figures with one wooden stick on a metal rim. Everything he did was small, as if he'd distilled the few gestures it takes to suggest a style.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930817","headline":"Amid Maze of Signals, Bats' Brains Can Form Precise Images of Prey","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/17/science/amid-maze-of-signals-bats-brains-can-form-precise-images-of-prey.html","abstract":"  PEOPLE who grew up before television had little difficulty \"seeing\" the Green Hornet, the Lone Ranger or Baby Snooks on radio.

By exonerating Mr. Altman of charges that he helped the bank deceive banking regulators about who owned First American Bankshares Inc. in Washington, the New York jury in effect rejected the premise that Mr. Altman and Clark M. Clifford, his former law partner and mentor, were the crucial American players in B.C.C.I.'s strategy to establish a franchise in the United States.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930817","headline":"Hawaii Hurricane Watch Ends","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/17/us/hawaii-hurricane-watch-ends.html","abstract":"  A hurricane watch was lifted in Hawaii today after Hurricane Fernanda weakened and moved away from the state.

Chicago Sun Times Challenge in Naperville, Ill. Schreyer shot a one-under-par 71 to finish with a 272 total on the White Eagle Club course. Her previous best showing this year was a 24th-place finish at the Dinah Shore Open, and she doubled her year's earnings with $71,250. For King, it was another disappointment, her 20th consecutive tournament without a victory. Schreyer and King were tied at 14 under when they got to the par-3 16th hole. Schreyer's tee shot on the 185-yard hole stopped in the left rough, and she chipped within 8 feet and made the putt. King's tee shot went over the green, and she three-putted from the fringe, her second putt missing from only 3 feet. The swing gave Schreyer the lead and the confidence she needed to go on to victory. King finished with a final-round 72, and Gail Graham was third with a 275 total after a closing 68. Kris Monaghan, Marta Figueras-Dotti and Dale Eggeling wound up tied for fourth.

But what was supposed to be a celebration of fruit and free trade is fast becoming a major source of friction between Washington and Tokyo. The apple farmers here in the nation's most productive fruit-growing region, who have spent more than decade setting up 3,500 acres of orchards to meet Japan's standards, now say they have been betrayed. Isolated Apple Orchards    Concerned about protecting its own highly lucrative apple-growing industry, Japan has long insisted that American fruit be free of any insects that might cross the Pacific. American farmers say most of Japan's pest concerns are phony, used as a convenient trade barrier. Still, until now, the Americans have dutifully done everything the Japanese said they would have to do to get their fruit into Japan.   American apple growers planted trees that were isolated from other orchards to minimize possible contact with insects. Special traps for bugs were set up. And some of the fruit has been individually wrapped in paper while still on the tree.   All was set for this year's breakthrough crop. But then, earlier this summer, Japan raised fresh concerns about pests that the American growers say are nonexistent.   Infuriated, the apple farmers of Washington State, who raise half the nation's crop and ship their fruit to 24 countries, including several in Asia, have taken the first step to bring trade sanctions against Japan. They are also talking about smashing Japanese electronic products in symbolic acts of defiance.   And at a recent food fair in Japan, American apple growers had a barren display with a sign that read, \"Empty boxes, empty promises.\"   \"We have gone through every hoop they have asked us to go through, and we're just fed up,\" said Doug Pauly, an apple grower and shipper here. \"We've had people tearing out pear trees and vineyards and rose bushes so they wouldn't be near these special orchards. Then, we get this close and the Japanese move the goal posts again. We can't win.\"   Apples are to Japanese and American trade policy what intercontinental missiles were to the cold war. Both sides have them. They have long been a bargaining chip. And now one side says it is time to put up or shut up.   In Japan, where a single apple can cost up to $5 at a fruit stand, American apples are forbidden by a long-standing agricultural policy that requires importers to prove that the produce is free of insects. The Americans say they have done this, but the Japanese say other scientific concerns remain.   The Americans, from the growers here to the highest reaches of the Clinton Administration, say it is a clear-cut issue. As such, apples have become the symbol of President Clinton's effort to open Japanese markets by appealing to the consumer. Gains for Both Countries    American apples would be a bargain to the Japanese consumer, while bringing huge profits to growers here. The growers had expected to sell up to 700,000 42-pound boxes, offering Japanese consumers the red and golden Delicious variety of apples at roughly half the price of Japan's major domestically grown variety, the Fuji. If, as expected, the growers were to get from $75 to $100 a box, it would bring them more than four times what they would receive in this country.   Two weeks ago, the Administration demanded that Japan take steps to import American apples beginning with next year's crop.   \"The U.S. side, for its part, has bent over backwards to accommodate Japanese concerns,\" Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, and Mike Espy, the Secretary of Agriculture, wrote in a letter to Masami Tanabu, Japan's Agriculture Minister. The American officials demanded a \"written Japanese commitment\" of all the steps needed for apples to get into Japan next year.   The Japanese, who already import a small amount of apples from New Zealand, have yet to respond to the specific complaints of the letter. Nor have they explained why these new insect questions were raised at the 11th hour. In a brief letter to the Clinton Administration they said the recent change in Government in Japan would delay an answer to the questions.   In the past, Japanese agriculture officials raised concerns about the possibility of pests infecting their own fruit if American apples were allowed into Japan. And they have denied that apples were being kept out for political reasons.   \"What Japan needs is for the the United States to prove that its apples are safe,\" KenjiNOr Nakano, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Washington, said in an interview. \"This is not a political issue. It is purely a technical one.\"   With the United States running a $50 billion trade deficit with Japan, apples are a relatively small item on the bargaining table. But, as Mr. Kantor said in his letter, the issue has become \"highly symbolic.\"   He raised the issue last month in talks between the two governments during Mr. Clinton's trip to Japan. In the American view, Japan bans United States apples for only one reason: to protect their own farmers.   Washington State's 3,500 apple farmers produce twice as many apples as their Japanese counterparts. But Japan has more than 10 times as many apple farmers, who raise their fruit on small plots and receive high prices for the produce, primarily Fuji apples.   Nor do they see any market logic behind Japanese protectionism. They contend that Washington apples, marketed for lunch buckets and snacks, would not cut into the markets of Japanese growers because the addition of American varieties would complement the more delicate Japanese product, change eating habits and expand the market.   They point to past food barriers on cherries and beef, which were lifted to the satisfaction of farmers in both countries. The success of Pacific Northwest cherries, which sometimes sell for as much as $1 a cherry in Japan, has fueled the drive by American growers to get into the lucrative Japanese market.   \"Here you have an industry that has played by the rules, done everything right, and in the end still cannot get into Japan,\" said Bill Bryant, an agricultural trade consultant in Seattle. \"Now it's becoming symbolic of blatant, unfair trading policies.\"   Of particular concern to the Japanese officials in the past has been whether American apples might carry a pest known as the coddling moth. The growers here say any such pests are killed during cold storage, when the apples, before shipment, are kept in a dark room at near freezing temperatures with almost no oxygen.   But after the coddling moth issue was satisfied, the Japanese raised a new concern about fire blight, a bacteria that typically infects pears. They wanted to make sure that no pear trees were grown near the apples; the Washington growers complied, planting orchards that were at least 500 meters, or nearly 1,641 feet, from pear trees.   Since then, new pest issues have been raised. \"We call it the bug-of-the-month club,\" Mr. Pauly said.   The Japanese say that even if these pests have not shown up in American fruit, their precaution is warranted by the need to protect their own produce from foreign insects.   Although they demanded that Japan take steps that would lead to apple imports by next year's harvest, some growers here have given up hope that diplomacy will work. They want to use the stick of reciprocal trade sanctions.   As for all those well-tended apples fattening on isolated trees near the Columbia River -- perhaps as many as 25 million pieces of fruit -- the growers say they will try to sell them to some other country. But given the cost it has taken to grow them, they say, they may not break even.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930817","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/17/nyregion/c-corrections-902493.html","abstract":"  An article on July 24 about the ouster of an executive of Disabled American Veterans misstated the number of veterans' organizations chartered by Congress.

Criminal trials held without the presence of the accused would deprive alleged war criminals of the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers. Some argue that defendants waive these rights when they fail to appear for trial. This argument, however, should be rejected in light of the importance of setting a standard of scrupulous compliance with the rule of law.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930818","headline":"As He Hoped, Kevorkian Is Charged in a Suicide","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/18/us/as-he-hoped-kevorkian-is-charged-in-a-suicide.html","abstract":"  Dr. Jack Kevorkian got his wish today when he became the first person charged under Michigan's new law banning assisted suicide, a felony that carries a penalty of up to four years in prison.

Discussions on its future were to have been deferred for three years, while Palestinian autonomy was given a chance to work in the occupied territories.\n\nBut the Palestinians have decided to go for broke in the talks, which resume Aug. 29. They argue that they were coerced into accepting the Madrid rules by the Israelis' refusal to deal under any other terms. They contend that Israel has shown few, if any, signs of a conciliatory spirit -- in the talks and in its occupation of the territories -- since the initial meeting at Madrid. So why, they ask, should they believe that Israel will be more willing to grant concessions on Jerusalem three years hence? The Israelis reply that a deal is a deal, and so far the U.S., sponsor of the talks, has backed them.
