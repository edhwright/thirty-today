Today, with the acquittal of Rodney Peairs, a homeowner who shot the 16-year-old Japanese high school student, Yoshihiro Hattori, just outside his door, Japan's anger shifted from America's gun culture to its justice system. Under what logic, television commentators and newspaper editorialists demanded, could the courts turn free a man who, under the Japanese legal system, would almost certainly be facing years in prison?","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930525","headline":"Democrats Drop Donors' Session With President","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/25/us/democrats-drop-donors-session-with-president.html","abstract":"  The Democratic Party must have figured it had come up with an an offer no lobbyist could refuse.

It runs through a round of zonal tournaments all over the globe to the interzonals, from which candidates are selected for the elimination matches that eventually produce a championship challenger. And Judit Polgar, not yet 17 years old, is on the way. In fact, she is the first woman to make it to the interzonal stage, to be held this summer in Biel, Switzerland.   Polgar, who lives in Budapest with her two extraordinary, chess-playing sisters, Zsuzsa, 24, and Zsofia, 18, got through narrowly by achieving a tie for second place behind the Bulgarian grandmaster Kiril Georgiev in the Budapest zonal competition. Polgar then won a double-round elimination tie-break tournament in March in Budapest against the three players deadlocked with her.  TIE-BREAK STANDINGS Player . . . W. . . . L. . . . D. . . . Pts. Polgar . . . 3 . . . 1 . . . 2 . . . 4 Ftacnik . . . 2 . . . 2 . . . 2 . . . 3 Wojtkiewicz . . . 1 . . . 1 . . . 4 . . . 3 Gdanski . . . 0 . . . 2 . . . 4 . . . 2    The third qualifier for the interzonal was Lubomir Ftacnik of Slovakia, who played even with the Polish champion Alexander Wojtkiewicz in the tie-breaks but beat him out in their games against each other by a score of 1 1/2- 1/2.    Polgar incisively disposed of the Polish international master Jacek Gdanski's French Defense in Round 2 with a powerful mating attack.   There are not many openings as demanding as the Winawer Variation of the French Defense, initiated by 3 . . . Bb4. After 4 e5 Ne7 5 a3 Bc3 6 bc, White has the bishop-pair and a space advantage on the kingside as against his awkward doubled c pawns and Black's space advantage on the queenside.   The most direct, aggressive way to exploit this is 7 Qg4. Yet Black need not passively defend but can plan on a counterattack with 7 . . . Qc7. For example, after 8 Qg7 Rg8 9 Qh7 cd 10 Ne2 Nbc6 11 f4 Bd7, it is difficult to contain Black's dynamic possibilities. Polgar, of course, knows all this and has previously shown a preference for the gambit sideline with 8 Bd3 that she used here.   For a long time, it was thought that accepting the gambit with 8 . . . cd 9 Ne2 dc 10 Qg7 Rg8 11 Qh7 Qe5 12 Bf4 Qf6 13 h4 was unfavorable for Black, but in a Milu-D. Popescu game last year in Bucharest, Romania, Popescu boldly tried 13 . . . Rg2!?, with the idea that 14 Bg3 e5 15 Kf1 Rg3 16 Ng3 Bg4 would give him powerfully dynamic counterplay. Milu backed off with 14 Kf1, but after 14 . . . e5!? 15 Kg2 ef 16 Qh5 Nbc6 17 Qf3 Ng6 18 Bg6? Qg6 19 Kf1 Bg4! 20 Qc3, Black would have had the upper hand with 20 . . . Qe4 21 f3 Bf3 22 Re1 O-O-O 23 Ng1 Bg2 24 Kf2 Qg6. Gdanski avoided this, surely because he suspected that Polgar had come prepared with a new deadly wrinkle.   Still, his supposedly quiet method of closing the position with 8 . . . c4 9 Be2 O-O was not a permanent damper to White's aggressions. Polgar's 11 Bg5 Qa5 12 Kd2! left the black king pretty much cut off from its potential queenside defenders, while the white king was really secure, as Polgar would soon show.   Gdanski's 12 . . . f5 had the clever point that 13 ef?! e5! 14 Qh5 g6! 15 Qh6 Nf5 16 Qh3 16 Nfd4 turns the attack over to Black.   Gdanski must have felt safe in taking a defender away from his king with 14 . . . Nc8. He was right in thinking that he had a legitimate attack of his own but erred in underestimating how fast Polgar could strike.   Polgar halted Gdanski's attack with 18 Ra4! Qa4 and then charged with 19 h6! After 19 . . . g6 20 Bf6, Gdanski suddenly realized that she was about to crush 20 . . . Kg8 by 21 Qg6! hg 22 h7 Kf7 23 Ng5 Ke8 24 h8/Q Qa3 25 Qg7 Ne7 26 Rh8.   After 20 . . . Rf6 21 ef Kg8 22 Qc7!, defense by 22 . . . Rd8 would crack under 23 Ne5 Qa5 24 f7 Kf8 (24 . . . Kh8 permits 25 Qd6 followed by 26 f8/Q) 25 Nd7. Gdanski's 22 . . . Nb4 was desperation. After 23 cb Qb4 24 Kg3 g5 25 Ng5, there was no help in 25 . . . Qc3 26 Bd3!, so Gdanski gave up.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930525","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/25/nyregion/c-corrections-791293.html","abstract":"  A picture caption on Friday about the illumination of the old Smallpox Hospital on Roosevelt Island described the project incorrectly.

Otherwise, the opposition of many deaf people to an operation that can sometimes restore hearing seems, at best, odd or idiosyncratic. At worst, especially in the case of denying the operation to a child, it seems cruel.   In my research for a book on the history of the disability rights movement, I found that fear of the cochlear implant comes out of the deaf community's well-founded sense of oppression. It is a reaction to more than a century of belief that deafness is a sickness, to be pitied, cured and eradicated. Americans born deaf have their own language, a sign language with its own grammar and sentence structure that is quite different from English. Using it, they built a vibrant 19th-century culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930527","headline":"American Business Needs More Foresight; Yes, He's Kidding","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/27/opinion/l-american-business-needs-more-foresight-yes-he-s-kidding-489294.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I was one among a good number of friends of Milt Moskowitz who called because they did not understand \"Spare the Knife, Spoil the Company\" (Op-Ed, May 14).
