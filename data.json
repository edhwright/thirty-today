Rather, the new findings indicate, prematurity is the principal culprit.

Each year in the United States about 31,000 fetuses die before delivery and 22,000 newborns die during the first 27 days of life. The United States has a higher infant mortality rate than those in 19 other countries, and this poor standing has long been attributed mainly to the large number of babies in this country who are born too small, including a large proportion who are born \"small for date,\" or weighing less than they should for the length of time they were in the womb.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950301","headline":"1945: Tokio Smashed : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/opinion/IHT-1945-tokio-smashed-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"ADMIRAL NIMITZ'S HEADQUARTERS, Guam - Two hundred and forty city blocks in the heart of Tokio were burned out by bombs of more than 200 raiding Super-Fortresses in Sunday's [Feb. 25] raid over the Japanese capital, the 21st Bomber Command reported.

First Mayor Giuliani said he would ignore a new law, passed by the City Council, that established an independent agency to monitor police corruption. Soon after, the administration dismissed Walter S. Mack Jr., the department's top corruption official -- the first civilian ever to head the post -- and replaced him with an insider. Then Mr. Giuliani seized control of the Public Affairs Department, in a clear attempt to manipulate the flow of police information.   As if all that weren't worrisome enough, Mr. Giuliani has now deepened public distrust by naming his own panel to monitor corruption. It will be accountable to him alone, and thus more susceptible to political pressure than the independent corruption commission created by the Council. It will also be significantly weaker than the independent commission.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950301","headline":"Republicans Modify Parts of Their Overhaul","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/us/the-104th-congress-welfare-republicans-modify-parts-of-their-overhaul.html","abstract":"  In response to Democratic criticism, House Republicans today modified some of the most contentious provisions of their welfare bill, including one that would have permanently denied cash assistance to children born to unmarried women under the age of 18.

The formula they proposed would also reward states that reduced the number of abortions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950301","headline":"Mexican Family's Black Sheep Was Often Out of the Picture","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/world/mexican-family-s-black-sheep-was-often-out-of-the-picture.html","abstract":"  When his younger brother was President of Mexico, Raul Salinas de Gortari was seldom seen, but his presence was often felt in questionable private business deals.

The immediate plan has the M.T.A.'s go-ahead for everything but the proposed cuts in service, which must go through public hearings.

Yet what wonderful music she makes within those limitations. Four Brahms lieder -- \"Dein blaues Auge,\" \"Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer,\" \"Auf dem Kirchhofe\" and \"Verzagen\" -- had the proper tone of sad repose, broken at times by piercing anguish. Three famous Tchaikovsky songs -- \"Again, as Before, Alone,\" \"None but the Lonely Heart\" and \"Was I Not a Little Blade of Grass\" -- profited from the singer's plush legato.

The vote is scheduled for 2 P.M., and the Republican majority leader, Bob Dole, pledged that if it failed, he would revive the issue at the height of the 1996 election campaign. He attacked several Democratic opponents for what he called a \"stunning flipflop\" on a measure they voted for a year ago, and other Republican senators criticized President Clinton's opposition, as well. On Tuesday, Mr. Dole suddenly postponed the vote on the amendment when it became clear that he had just 66 of the 67 votes needed. The decision to have the final vote today came after apparently unsuccessful attempts to reach a compromise that would keep Social Security trust funds off limits to budget cutters. \"There is no reason a balanced budget amendment could not pass with nearly 80 votes in a matter of a few minutes -- if they're willing to protect Social Security,\" said Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll found that 79 percent of Americans said they favored a constitutional amendment that would require the Federal Government to balance the budget 2002, but only 32 percent said they were in favor if it would require cuts in Social Security.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950302","headline":"On the Angry Airwaves, the Response to the Budget Vote Is Underwhelming","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/02/us/104th-congress-talk-radio-angry-airwaves-response-budget-vote-underwhelming.html","abstract":"  Having come up one short of the 67 votes he needed to pass a balanced-budget amendment, Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, turned yesterday to Rush Limbaugh, the talk radio figure who has served as an electronic precinct captain for Republicans in Congress.

Following are excerpts from Caryn James's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 24. The film opens today at Angelika Film Center, Mercer and Houston Streets, Greenwich Village.   A very young woman dressed in a schoolgirl's uniform steps onto the stage of a strip club called Exotica.  Eric, a disk jockey with a voice as creepy as it is suggestive, introduces her as Christina, \"a sassy bit of jailbait,\" and says she will dance at your table for $5. Eric's crass words seem at odds with this extravagant place. The men wear suits and ties, the lush jungle decor evokes a Rousseau painting after innocence has been lost, and everything is nearly respectable. Somehow, Eric and Christina will have to cross paths with Thomas, a meek, bespectacled man whom Canadian customs officials have been watching through a one-way mirror as he enters the country.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950303","headline":"Pope Reschedules A Visit to the Region","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/03/nyregion/pope-reschedules-a-visit-to-the-region.html","abstract":"  Catholics disappointed when Pope John Paul II canceled a visit to the NewYork region last year were heartened when the Vatican announced that the Popewould make a four-day trip to the United States in October.

Mr. Korsantiya, who is Alexander Toradze's teaching assistant at Indiana University, has inspired other critical plaudits as well. Unfortunately, on this occasion, he did not distinguish himself from many other well-schooled contenders for attention.    His assets are easy to catalogue. He began his career as a prodigy in his native Republic of Georgia.

The rest of it is underground in a basement, or in a warehouse. Down in the reserves, paintings are suspended like pots and pans from giant wire racks. It's an artistic democracy: the good, the bad and the ugly hang side by side, without wall labels or Acoustiguides to tell you what to admire. Discovering a good painting down here is much more exciting than seeing it upstairs in the galleries, pinned and fixed like a dead butterfly.    \"Grand Reserves,\" at the Brooklyn Museum, tries to bring some of this excitement upstairs, gathering together 10 hitherto unknown canvases, most of which have been sitting for years in the reserves. (A few are recent acquisitions.) A text panel at the entrance to the exhibition explains that the museum is preparing a catalogue of its vast collection of American paintings (more than 7,500 canvases). In the course of researching its holdings, a certain number of worthy pictures have been \"rediscovered.\" Often, their appearance has been radically altered as a result of cleaning and conservation. The question is: How were these 10 paintings chosen out of the thousands of possible candidates? The copious wall texts offer no direct explanation, but, reading between the lines, you can see several varieties of historical revisionism at work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950303","headline":"Driven to Succeed, They Died in the Ultimate Test in Frigid Water and Fog","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/03/us/driven-to-succeed-they-died-in-the-ultimate-test-in-frigid-water-and-fog.html","abstract":"  Norman Tillman grew up poor and ambitious in rural Grenada, Miss., one of five children reared by a mother who scrubbed floors at the local hospital.

Seventy major bases and hundreds of smaller installations were closed or cut back during the first three rounds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950303","headline":"Last U.S. Marines Quit Somalia as Escorts for the U.N.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/03/world/last-us-marines-quit-somalia-as-escorts-for-the-un.html","abstract":"  Bringing an end to the United Nations involvement in Somalia, the last American marines left Mogadishu's shores early this morning, leaving behind a mission that fed Somalia's hungry, but did not end the fighting here.   The 72-hour operation by American and Italian forces to escort the last United Nations troops safely out of the country ended without any American casualties, although late Thursday night, the marines opened fire with several fusillades of machine-gun and cannon fire as Somalis tried to enter the narrow American zone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950303","headline":"At the Bar; Suing dictators (and similar types) here for violations committed elsewhere.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/03/us/bar-suing-dictators-similar-types-here-for-violations-committed-elsewhere.html","abstract":"  Just as he was about to be handed a degree from the Kennedy School at Harvard University in 1991, Gen. Hector Gramajo was served with papers charging him in a Federal civil suit for his role in torturing people in his homeland, Guatemala.

The next day, when he was served with a second set of papers in connection with the rape of a nun by soldiers under his command, he spat on the process server.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950303","headline":"Replacement Yankees Outclassed by Dodgers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/03/sports/baseball-replacement-yankees-outclassed-by-dodgers.html","abstract":"  Don't get embarrassed. Please, don't get embarrassed. Those unenviable thoughts were swimming through the minds of Buck Showalter and perhaps Tommy Lasorda before replacement baseball became a reality today when the players wearing Yankees uniforms opposed the players wearing Dodgers uniforms on a field usually reserved for the real Yankees and the real Dodgers.   On a sunny, breezy day that was made for baseball, about 200 fans were at Fort Lauderdale Stadium to watch Frank Eufemia throw a strike past Chris Latham to christen the dawning of replacement games. This notion would have been scoffed at when the major league players went on strike last Aug. 12. So far, no one was too embarrassed. There is still time for that.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950303","headline":"Home Video","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/03/movies/home-video-228495.html","abstract":"Sheriff chases robber-lovers.

But the evidence of late is that the selling pace has picked up, and prices are holding up. \n\nSeveral of the city's real estate brokers agree on the improvement in activity in single-family and multifamily town houses over the last year. According to one broker, Ambrose-MarElia, 129 town houses were sold in Manhattan last year compared with 91 the year before. Using somewhat different geographic boundaries, the Corcoran Group reported sales of 89 town houses, up from 76 in 1993. And Massey Knakal Realty Services Inc. recorded sales of 21 units, a 19 percent increase over 1993 in its coverage area, from 14th to 96th Street and 10th to Fifth Avenue.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19950303","time":"1995-03-03
