When the museum announced that it would begin collecting photographs, it did so on the strength of a 1992 gift, including both artworks and cash valued by the museum at $5 million, from the foundation the photographer set up a year before he died in 1989. The new gallery, on the fourth floor of the addition to the Guggenheim's familiar spiral building, is also named after Mapplethorpe.   To inaugurate the space, Germano Celant, the museum's curator of contemporary art, has selected 46 self-portraits from throughout Mapplethorpe's career. The show begins with his Polaroids from the early 1970's when, fresh out of art school, he began to explore photography. It concludes with his searing images from the late 80's, when he was afflicted with AIDS.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931126","headline":"LUTHERANS BALK ON A SEX POLICY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/26/us/lutherans-balk-on-a-sex-policy.html","abstract":"  A four-year effort by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America to write a statement on human sexuality has nearly foundered since reports of a first draft alarmed members of the 5.2 million-member denomination.    \"The proposed statement as written is mortally wounded,\" wrote the Rev.

He announced that his trio -- with Dave Holland on bass and Gene Jackson on drums -- would play Cole Porter's \"I Love You,\" adding, \"You'll never recognize it.\" Beyond the first few melodic phrases, he was right; the tune slipped behind odd harmonies, dissolved into streams of single notes, fanned out into two-handed tremolo chords and dispensed salvos of dissonance. Afterward, a smiling Mr. Hancock played the tune slowly and explained what he had done: a key change here, and here, and again, turning Porter's harmonies into his own.    Mr. Hancock delights in transformations. He toys with rhythms, turning conventional off-beat chords into a game of syncopated hide-and-seek; he reworks harmonies, adding notes until the original implications are warped. He investigates silences and subtleties; he revels in high-speed runs and splashy, gospelly chords. His playing carries him to the hazy borderline between improvisations that can be explained by harmonic theory and those that are pure dramatic gesture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931126","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/26/arts/art-in-review-411493.html","abstract":"  Josef Sudek  'Poetic Images'   Sander Gallery  19 East 76th Street  Manhattan  Through Jan. 8    The atmosphere is palpable in Josef Sudek's misty, romantic photographs.

The appealing musical revue deftly sketches the pre-swing musical era when Paul Whiteman was considered the king of jazz, and the music is young, lilting and uncomplicated. Shows are at 9 and 11 tonight and tomorrow. Admission is $20, and there is a two-drink minimum. S. H. San Francisco Stylist    Weslia Whitfield, the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-6800. An intelligent, understated pop-jazz stylist, Weslia Whitfield, from San Francisco, made her New York City club debut last April at the Algonquin, and she is back already with a brand-new show, \"Two for the Road, Travels Through American Song.\" In addition to the title song from the Audrey Hepburn movie, Ms. Whitfield's program includes such road songs as \"Gypsy in My Soul\" and \"Let's Take the Long Way Home.\" High points include a medley of songs from the Alan Jay Lerner-Burton Lane show \"Royal Wedding,\" and \"Photographs,\" a little-known gem by Fran Landesman and Alec Wilder. Performances are at 9 and 11:30 tonight and tomorrow. There is a $30 music charge and a $15 minimum. S.

History would have us believe that this has been a time of revolution: tonality overthrown, Romantic forms reduced to Classical ones, heart-on-sleeve effusion tempered to accommodate wit and discretion or else sarcasm and despair, even violence.   If Schmidt's Fourth Symphony -- which the New York Philharmonic under Franz Welser-Most brought to Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday night -- is to be believed, Wagner never died and the 20th century is only a postscript to the 19th. It is astonishing to think that this serenely confident turn-of-the-century piece actually belongs to the year 1933.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931126","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/26/arts/art-in-review-415793.html","abstract":"  Tobi Kahn   Mary Ryan Gallery  24 West 57th Street  Manhattan  Through tomorrow    Over the years, Tobi Kahn has gradually moved from painting dark, Ryderesque landscapes to bold organic forms, although crucial features of his work have not changed.

Same decor, same parasol-laden drinks. But not for long. In the spring, the space will be occupied by a new restaurant, Gauguin.    Behind this project are Mark and Alan Fleishman, who own Tatou, a restaurant and supper club on East 50th Street in Manhattan. Scott Cohen, the chef at Tatou, is the consulting chef for Gauguin, which he described as having a French-Polynesian theme with big drinks in big glasses but more serious food than Trader Vic's, French with Polynesian overtones. It will have 240 seats in 8 areas.  Truffles in High Gear    In September, as soon as the first white truffles arrive from Italy, restaurants start shaving them over pasta and risotto. But early truffles are not the best truffles. Now they are larger, with more fragrance and flavor and better texture, and this is the peak of the season.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931126","headline":"Whenever Opportunity Knocks, Jets' Rookie Murrell Comes Out Running","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/26/sports/pro-football-whenever-opportunity-knocks-jets-rookie-murrell-comes-out-running.html","abstract":"  In the fourth quarter of the Jets-Bengals game last Sunday, Johnny Johnson was sitting on the sideline nursing bruised ribs, Richie Anderson was out with a severely sprained ankle, Brad Baxter was trying to get his broken chinstrap reattached to his helmet and Jets Coach Bruce Coslet was about to flip his wig.

P.S.A.L.  Adams (8-3) at Lincoln (9-0), A Semifinals, 12 P.M.  Key Players: The Adams defenders, led by linebackers Jerry Corollo and Frank LoMonaco, will have to play the game of their lives if they hope to stop the city's best runner, Frankie Sinclair (133 carries for 1,361 yards and 23 touchdowns), and one of the metropolitan area's top quarterbacks, Corey Valentine (32 of 70 for 887 yards, 14 touchdowns). The Railsplitters' defense, paced by linebackers Jeff Miller (58 tackles, 2 sacks) and Mark Navarette (58 tackles), is not too shabby, either, having shut out its opponents six times this season. The defensive unit goes by the nickname G-Men, after the defensive coordinator, Ed Grezinski. The Adams wing-T offense is led by fullback Michael Richardson. Comment: \"It's a very difficult task to stop all their weapons,\" said Adams Coach Angelo Palumbo. \"We just hope that they don't embarrass us.\" Lehman (8-1) at Canarsie (9-0), A Semifinals, 12 P.M.  Key Players: Although Robert Talley (142 carries for 1,142) is one of the best backs in the city, Lehman can't expect him to run successfully against a Canarsie defense that has allowed only 27 points. Quarterback Willie Nelson (40 of 80 for 375 yards, 2 touchdowns) is going to have to throw the ball downfield to Larry Belton and Kevin Reavis if Lehman expects to score on a defense that has registered five shutouts. Sam Shehadeh (more than 100 tackles, and 7 sacks), Ernest Coakley (12 sacks), Cory Patterson (5 interceptions) and Lance Schulters (4 interceptions, including 2 for touchdowns) are the Chiefs' mainstays on defense. Offensively, Canarsie plays a ball-control offense with Schulters (104 carries for 868 yards, 14 touchdowns) and Eric Smith (130 carries for 1,134 yards, 11 touchdowns), usually wearing the opponents down. Comment: Lehman and Canarsie have met in the semifinals for the last two years, with Lehman winning both games: 24-6 last year and 18-12 in 1991. Fort Hamilton (9-0) vs. Flushing (9-1), B final at Midwood Field, 12 P.M. Key Players: Fort Hamilton Coach Vincent Laino said that the biggest question in this matchup is whether his team can cope with Ashley Thomas's speed. \"He's just a sensational runner,\" said Laino of the back, who has rushed for 1,100 yards and 19 touchdowns this season. \"We're not all that quick defensively. We're more of an attack defense.\" Fort Hamilton's defensive unit is led by linebacker Jimmy Koutroumanos (100 tackles) and tackle Joe Barbieri, who averages 7 tackles a game. On offense, the Tigers rely on running back Angelo LiCausi. Flushing's defense, which features linebacker Bienbenudo Hernandez (90 tackles), has not allowed a point in 14 quarters. The Red Devils' quarterback, Frank Joaquin, who is a native of the Dominican Republic, speaks little English. \"It's really amazing,\" said his coach, Mike Sarachek. \"We send the play in and somehow he manages to call it right every time.\" Comment: Fort Hamilton, the P.S.A.L. B defending champion, played its first varsity football game against Flushing in 1991 and defeated the Red Devils, 22-8. Westchester and Rockland North Rockland (11-0) vs. Jamestown (10-2), Class A State Final, 8 P.M., at the Carrier Dome, Syracuse University. Key Players: North Rockland quarterback Jeff Becker has thrown 4 of his 9 scoring strikes to Chris Jackson. The Raiders' rushing attack is sparked by Marcus Larkins (822 yards and 11 touchdowns) and Rasson Wiley, who has rushed for more than 200 yards in each of his last four games. Jamestown, which is located south of Buffalo, has nine players on defense who weigh no more than 170 pounds. Anthony Cusimano, a 5-foot-5-inch, 140-pound defensive end, leads Jamestown's defensive unit, along with tackles Aaron Barnett (6-1, 167) and Jamie Bloomquist, who this past year wrestled at 119 pounds. Bloomquist has since bulked up to 167 pounds. \"They're like a bunch of rats running to a piece of cheese,\" said Jamestown Coach Wally Huckno of his undersize defense. Jamestown's offensive stars are quarterback Jim Barlow, who has passed for more than 700 yards, and tailback Jamie Nelson, who has rushed for 1,050 yards. Comment: The North Rockland-Jamestown game is the final game today at the Carrier Dome in the state's first playoff championship. The Class B final pits Chittenango (11-0) vs. Yorktown (10-1), at 5 P.M.; the Class C matches Rye (9-1) vs. Caledonia-Mumford (10-1), at 2 P.M., and the Class D features Tuckahoe (10-0) vs. Clyde-Savannah (11-1), at 11 A.M. All Eyes on Ornstein  Gus Ornstein of Fieldston has set up two official college visits -- to Miami on Dec. 19 and to Syracuse in early January. Other schools interested in the 6-foot-5-inch, 205-pound quarterback are Brigham Young, Boston College, Notre Dame, Michigan and all of the Ivy League schools. Ornstein, a switch-hitting first baseman in baseball, has also been scouted by the Mets, the Chicago Cubs and the Colorado Rockies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931127","headline":"Even in Bad Times Russia Needs Phones","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/27/your-money/IHT-even-in-bad-times-russia-needs-phones.html","abstract":"PETERSBURG Long Distance Inc., the company billed as \"the first Russian equity opportunity\" when it began trading over-the-counter in the United States earlier this year, has recovered from last month's coup attempt and is facing next month's el","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19931127","headline":"RABIN SAYS ISRAEL MAY NOT MEET DATE TO BEGIN PULLOUT","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/27/world/rabin-says-israel-may-not-meet-date-to-begin-pullout.html","abstract":"  With little more than two weeks to go and tensions running high, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is warning that Israel may be unable to meet a deadline of Dec. 13 for the start of its troop withdrawal and the assumption of Palestinian authority in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.   \"The date is not sacred because it was set as a target,\" Mr. Rabin told reporters on Thursday night.

Just as in her novels, when people are knocked off one by one, the Giants' conference rivals are falling by the wayside and clearing a path for the Giants right into the playoffs.   Their biggest boost came on Thursday when, on a snowy and icy day outside Dallas, Leon Lett did something the Giants haven't been able to do: beat the Cowboys. The Giants will be sending Lett a Thanksgiving thank-you, a football with a note attached that reads, \"Go ahead, pick it up.\" Actually, the Giants wouldn't be that cruel, but they are the biggest beneficiaries of Lett's goof because Dallas's defeat has given them sole possession of first place in the National Football Conference's Eastern Division. Seizing a Second Chance    Dallas lost to Miami on Thursday after Lett tried to jump on a blocked field-goal attempt in the final seconds of the game when all he had to do was leave the ball alone. If he had, the ball belonged to Dallas, and so did the game. Instead, Lett touched the ball, could not control it, and Miami recovered. The Dolphins, having been given a second chance, then kicked a 19-yard field goal as time expired and walked off the field with a 16-14 victory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931127","headline":"Investigators Start Inquiry At Tunnel","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/27/nyregion/investigators-start-inquiry-at-tunnel.html","abstract":"  Like explorers on a fantastic journey into the center of the earth, a team of investigators descended into an enormously deep steel-and-concrete shaft at a construction site in Queens yesterday to examine tangled wreckage and the winch that fell in at midweek, killing one worker and injuring seven others.

I remembered enormous trees, elms I think, toppling soundlessly, and hissing electric wires writhing on the sidewalk.   My grandmother got out her kerosene lamps, I know that, and roasted potatoes on the edge of the coal furnace; dishes were washed and toilets flushed with water from a neighbor's well. But until I watched a recent PBS documentary on the Hurricane of '38 -- always called by New Englanders \"the Storm\" or \"the Great Storm\" because \"hurricane\" seemed foreign, even pretentious -- I had no real idea of the horror of a storm for which there'd been no warning and against which there were no defenses.

Local chefs have such an enviable head start that one would think they couldn't miss. Well, some do, mostly by gilding the lilies with incongruous sauces and other embellishments.   But when a chef hits the mark here, the results can be sublime. Below is a roundup of some Seattle area restaurants well worth visiting. All exude passionate dedication to regional ingredients like salmon, ling cod, Dungeness crab, spot prawns, Olympia oysters, venison and local mushrooms. Oriental influences are increasingly common, and rarely does one encounter cream-and-butter sauces in this health-conscious corner of the nation.  Dahlia Lounge   On fog-dampened week nights in autumn, downtown Seattle is not exactly a Mardi gras, yet the scene is always spirited at this stylish four-year-old establishment that serves bold (and occasionally bizarre) new American cuisine.   The setting is provocative: soaring ceilings, vermilion walls, vintage neon, illuminated papier-mache fish and flower-patterned banquettes. For all the action in the dining room, it never gets distractingly loud.    Dahlia Lounge is a husband-wife effort, with Tom Douglas running the kitchen and Jackie Cross tending to the guests. Mr. Douglas seems to be an inveterate experimenter.  And just as many of Thomas Edison's early light bulbs probably shattered in his face, so do some of the chef's concoctions.   Why, for example, would anyone take a classic pasta puttanesca, with garlic, olives and tomatoes, and lay over it big slices of rare-seared tuna? It's like adding wings to a Mercedes. A supposedly crisp-skinned garlic duck was not crispy, but rather covered with acrid burned garlic. Green bean risotto seemed like a fine idea, but it wasn't when the beans were served untrimmed and raw.   Those exceptions aside, one can have a perfectly satisfying evening at Dahlia Lounge by cruising in the middle of the road with dishes like butternut squash soup; sauteed Alaskan spot prawns with Provencal herbs; grilled Alaska king salmon with ginger-sake butter, and grilled rosemary lamb chops with smoked-tomato ratatouille.  Kaspar's   In Seattle, the options for waterfront dining are diverse. One of the more imaginative spots is Kaspar's, a semicasual restaurant atop an office building overlooking the shipyards of Elliott Bay.   Kaspar Donier, the chef-owner, is Swiss-born, but he wears his zeal for Northwest products on his sleeve. Nancy Donier, his wife, is a welcoming and earnest hostess. Mr. Donier offers two menus: one featuring his signature dishes, another with nightly specials. On a recent evening one special was exceptionally light ravioli filled with sweet rock prawns and spinach, all in a refreshingly light lemon sauce. His shellfish and wild rice chowder, from the regular menu, was creamy and delightfully briny, overflowing with mussels, scallops and clams. Firm, fresh gnocchi was the richest appetizer, as the dumplings were paired with artichoke hearts and napped in a rich, tasty Gruyere-flavored sauce. Only the Dungeness crab hash went unfinished for lack of seasoning.   Three signature main courses are good bets: rare-cooked king salmon under a latticework of crunchy fried potatoes, braised lamb shank with garlic and rosemary sauce, and bouillabaisse built on a sturdy fish stock with the addition of lentils.    Kaspar's has a good selection of Northwest wines at average prices. As for desserts, let the chef put together an assortment -- plum tart with cardamom-and-rum ice cream; pecan-and-sweet-potato pie with Grand Marnier cream, and ripe-fruit sorbets are among the choices. Wild Ginger   If you want to know what East-meets-West cooking is all about, Wild Ginger is the place to find out. The creation of the young, soft-spoken owner, Rick Yoder, who spent several years in Southeast Asia filling his cognitive shopping cart with ideas, this is perhaps the most provocative, and fun, restaurant in Seattle.   The big open dining room with cream-tinted walls, dramatic lighting and high-backed wooden booths is both casual and formal. A mahogany satay bar is a wonderful spot for a quick snack or multicourse tasting.  All three satays sampled were arresting: pork basted with coconut milk and served with a complex hot sauce; large prawns in an Indonesian-style marinade of garlic, galangal (a type of ginger), chili and coconut, and a simple but delicious plate of grilled, garlic-infused Chinese eggplant.   Choosing wines to match these exotic flavors is a challenge. High acid sauvignon blancs and chenin blancs work well, as do some beers.   Main courses to try include sweet-hot black-pepper scallops with a soy and rice-wine dipping sauce; roasted duck seasoned with cinnamon and star anise and served with steamed buns that are used to make little sandwiches, and any of the noodle dishes. The steamed Chilean sea bass with shallot sauce, recommended by the waiter, lacked pizazz compared with the other dishes. Wild Ginger offers impressive daily vegetarian specials, something that is much in demand in this part of the country.  Szmania's   This smart-looking, friendly spot in the residential village of Magnolia, about 15 minutes from downtown Seattle, typifies the trend for top chefs to move from the city to outlying areas. The dining room is cheerful and bright, with lots of blond wood, colorful local art and a horseshoe-shaped dining bar.   The strapping German-born chef and owner, Ludger Szmania (SMAHN-yah), was previously chef at the highly regarded Four Seasons Olympic Hotel. His menu defies description -- a little Pacific Northwest, a little Oriental, some German and Mexican thrown in for good measure.  Yet his mastery of blending flavors is immediately evident.   At lunch you can start with nicely browned Dungeness crab cakes with a roasted-pepper aioli, grilled Oriental chicken salad with a sprightly ginger-sesame dressing or a tortilla salad with spicy seafood and roasted peppers. Main courses include tasty smoked mozzarella ravioli in a simple but pleasing fresh tomato sauce or perfectly roasted monkfish under a lid of homemade potato chips with a light chanterelle cream sauce.   The signature dessert is Magnolia dream cake, a stratified indulgence of peanut butter cream, chocolate cake and chocolate mousse. The Herbfarm   What began as a backyard herb garden selling at a roadside stand in this gloriously rustic area about 30 minutes east of Seattle has evolved into a leafy wonderland and one of the best restaurants in the Pacific Northwest. It is also highly sought after, with an extremely restrictive reservations policy (see listing on page 6). The Herbfarm is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday only.    A visit to The Herbfarm can be much more than an extraordinary meal. It also includes a tour of the magnificent, meticulously cultivated theme gardens -- 17 in all, covering 6 acres -- and kitchen garden. In addition, guests are given talks on the food's provenance and preparation by the owners and the chef during the nine-course tasting meal (there is only one menu, which changes weekly), and samplings of greenery that you never suspected were suitable for two-legged species.   A recent dinner in the enchanting cottage that houses the restaurant, which seats only 32, started with a glass of dry 1988 Argyle Oregon Brut topped with sprigs of lemon verbena.    \"You will notice that the herb gives the sparkling wine a wonderful aroma, but it does not affect the flavor at all,\" explained Ron Zimmerman, who owns the restaurant along with his wife, Carrie Van Dyck. The table was set with name cards atop mini-pumpkins, elegant silver and stemware and an arrangement of wildflowers and herbs.   Each course is prepared in an open kitchen by the chef, Jerry Traunfeld, with detailed explanations of each ingredient. \"During the evening you will be served many strange and different flowers,\" he said. \"And all are edible unless we say otherwise.\"   The first course was an aromatic tart of wild boletus mushrooms from southern Alaska, onions and marjoram, along with nasturtiums stuffed with nasturtium capers, and tiny Olympia oysters. From there it got exotic: a briny combination of Dungeness crab-and-fennel dumplings, Whidbey Island mussels, Pacific spot prawns and wild cauliflower mushrooms; little pumpkins containing pumpkin gnocchi with chanterelles and sage under shavings of a local sheep's-milk cheese, and herb-smoked wild king salmon (\"Line caught,\" Mr. Traunfeld assured us) with beet and arugula sauces.   The show went on at a blissfully slow pace -- more than three hours -- as we reveled in herb-encrusted local lamb with a ginger and coriander sauce, a magnificent salad of wild greens and flowers, a splendid apple souffle and apple-caramel ice cream.Five Pacific Northwest wines accompanied the meal, which concluded with a vibrant 1927 Madeira.   All of this luxury comes at a price: dinner came to $115 a person with wine; the six-course lunch is $50. page 6, sub head only  SAMPLING A SPIRITED DINING SCENE    Prices given below, with the exception of The Herbfarm, include a glass of house wine.

This is the primary distinction of \"Poverty Pop: The Esthetics of Necessity,\" a timely yet problematic show at Exit Art/The First World in SoHo. Its focus is the widespread practice among youngish artists of parlaying found, often worn, materials and objects into art. Such efforts constitute the visual equivalent of grunge, but they also perpetuate one of the most resilient, if cliched, legacies of Modernism: assemblage, the common cockroach of 20th-century techniques.    At least since Kurt Schwitters and the Dadaists, artists have been inspired to work with things found on the street, in the attic or dustbin or at the dime store. It saves money on materials and at the same time makes a statement about materialism, both in art and in the world at large. In the downscale 90's, the art of recycled objects has been on the upswing, a symptom of the straitened economy, of growing environmental awareness and also of the decade's rejection of its predecessor. In the 80's, artists appropriated glamorous images and sparkling new merchandise, critiquing commodity culture while producing rather desirable commodities themselves. Now, commodity culture is more often examined through its castoffs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"Miss O'Malley And Mr. Quinn","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/style/weddings-miss-o-malley-and-mr-quinn.html","abstract":"  Katherine Ann O'Malley, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs. James A.

An important part of the work couldn't make the trip, however; the Chapelle du Rosaire in Vence, near Nice, designed by Matisse with a Dominican brother and two architects from 1948 to 1951 for the Dominican sisters there. It was represented in the exhibition only by the vestments the artist designed and by photographs of the chapel's luminous stained glass windows and of Matisse working in bed on the designs for them. \n\nIn June 1943, when it became clear that Nice would not be safe from bombing, Matisse -- then 79 -- left his home there and retired a few miles inland to Vence. Although the war was to follow the old man to Vence -- three bombs fell in his garden -- his stay was extraordinarily productive. One of the fruits of those years was the chapel he designed for the Dominican sisters, who ran a convalescent home across the street from Matisse's home. He owed the Dominicans a debt of gratitude, perhaps his life: they had cared for him in Lyons during a difficult convalescence from surgery earlier in the war.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"From Little Packages Come Big Sounds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/arts/pop-music-from-little-packages-come-big-sounds-815893.html","abstract":"  WHEN \"CROSSROADS,\" A FOURCD boxed set chronicling the career of Eric Clapton, went gold shortly after it was released in 1988, the recording industry took notice.

Hitchcock saw these antebellum structures -- he refused to refer to them as architecture -- as looking ahead, first to the work of H. H.

Political consultants who have worked with and against Mr. Rollins say that the election of Mrs. Whitman and the weeks of controversy that followed his statement about payments to black ministers show the 51-year-old Republican has a golden touch at politics but a tin ear for the effect of what he sometimes says.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"Continental Drift","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/travel/travel-advisory-images-continental-drift.html","abstract":"  A recent magazine advertisement and a cable TV commercial for Qantas, the Australian airline, promised \"a welcome as warm as the sun on our beaches.\" The beach shown, however, was on Oahu.

The story, celebrated in Japan annually on the seventh day of the seventh month by a festival of feasting and fireworks, lies at the heart of an exhibition at the Textile Museum, \"Beyond the Tanabata Bridge: A Textile Journey in Japan.\" The show makes clear that women weavers were an integral part of Japan's past and its folklore. It will be at the museum, which is near Embassy Row, through Feb. 27.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"IN SHORT: FICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/books/in-short-fiction-433593.html","abstract":"  MAGIC REALISM PIANO STORIES By Felisberto Hernandez.

I watch my 9-year-old son race dozens of brilliant Sally Lightfoot crabs over the black braided ropes of lava. I see him pirouette with baby sea lions, I watch him inspire the trust of the curious Galapagos mockingbird until it rests its trembling body next to his trembling hand.   Last June Josh and I boarded a 60-foot motor sailer, Beagle III, and ventured into the unknown in more ways than we had imagined. We booked onto a seven-day \"family\" cruise around the islands that was made up of nine strangers (four families of various parent-child combinations) who were thrown together in a living space that even honeymooners might find too intimate. The double bunk rooms were burnished with pine trim but endowed with just enough floor space for one person to get dressed. In the two miniature bathrooms, you could sit on the head and take a shower at the same time. But what the handsome old yacht lacked in comfort, it made up for in funky charm. A former research boat with the archipelago's Darwin Research Station, the Beagle had sprawling two-level deck space, an environmental conscience (no unrecyclable cans aboard), a quirky crew of three Ecuadoreans and their Ecuadorean captain, who roughhoused with the kids when they weren't cooking up hearty, if oversalted, feasts of fresh vegetables and fish, and Fabio Penafiel, a sharp-eyed English-speaking naturalist who not only knew every species on the islands, but could often bring them forth by imitating their calls. Miraculously, the passengers, who included three boys aged 15 (a potentially disastrous situation for my much littler one) were all good-humored, adventurous folk who made Josh feel right at home.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"Choral Performances Herald Holiday Season","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/nyregion/music-choral-performances-herald-holiday-season.html","abstract":"  THE holiday season is fast approaching and so are the choral programs that normally dot the concert landscape in December.

For example, at the emotional leadup to the next in the modern superpower cycle of tidy, winnable wars, a pacifist might bear Shaw in mind: \"Patriotism is a pernicious, psychopathic form of idiocy.\" In the same spirit there is Shaw on Christmas: \"Christmas is forced on a reluctant and disgusted nation by the shopkeepers and the press: on its own merits it would wither and shrivel in the fiery breath of universal hatred; and anyone who looked back to it would be turned into a pillar of greasy sausages.\"   All right, so you can't quite agree. But keep in mind that in wielding his pen like a nasty shard of truth, Shaw could just as easily have been idly window-shopping here and now, taking Shavian note of some of the Yuletide features offered in neighborhood boites for consumers searching beyond the everything already possessed. There is Assumption Abbey fruitcake, for example, on fancy display for a pretty penny in one East Side shop, and so valued because it is made to the recipe of \"world-class chef Jean-Pierre Auge\" and baked in the Ozarks by silence-enshrouded Trappist monks whose lives are, incidentally, dedicated to the world-class messiah of the current seasonal tidings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"Leaping From E Street to 'Late Night'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/arts/television-leaping-from-e-street-to-late-night.html","abstract":"  WHEN MAX WEINBERG was a teen-ager, he had a drum teacher named Gene Thaler who would tell him stories about his friend Ed Shaughnessy, the drummer in the \"Tonight Show\" band. \"He always used to say what a great gig that is,\" Mr. Weinberg recalled. \"You get lots of money and then you go home, and you don't have to go on the road.

Though every bit in step with the cultural revolution taking place in Harlem at the time, Mr. Lawrence owed much of his early success to the art dealer Edith Gregor Halper, who, after showing the panels in her Greenwich Village gallery, succeeded in selling half of the series to the Museum of Modern Art and the remaining paintings to the Phillips Collection in Washington. The Phillips has now reunited the paintings in a traveling exhibition for which it has produced this handsome catalog, JACOB LAWRENCE: The Migration Series (Rappahannock Press, 1627 I Street, Suite 610, Washington, D.C. 20006, $40), edited by the show's curator, Elizabeth Hutton Turner. Ten scholars, including Henry Louis Gates Jr., have contributed historical footnotes to Mr. Lawrence's career, as well as lucid commentary on the sources of the social and political conditions that gave rise to the mass black exodus north. Most telling, however, are the paintings themselves, which dramatize the story of the migration -- not only the hopes, fears and hardships of a people leaving home and friends for the unknown, but the anonymity and despair many experienced once they had arrived, finding tenement life, dead-end jobs, and a new form of racial discrimination based on custom rather than law. \"We are absolutely a people telling stories,\" Mr. Lawrence has said, a concept that he illustrates with particular grace in these eloquent paintings.

In addition to focusing on his relationships with his wife and a beautiful young model, the film examined the process of creating a work of art.\n\nBut four-hour films are hard to attract the public, and so with two hours cut from the original and the focus changed to concentrate on the personal stories more than the technical aspect of painting, the movie has been re-released as \"Divertimento.\" \n\nThe Cinema Arts Center on Park Avenue in Huntington is offering the two versions, the shortened one from Friday through Dec. 6 and the original next Sunday and on Dec. 7. (423-7610).\nJULIE ANDREWS BENEFIT\n\n Julie Andrews will be in Sag Harbor on Saturday to offer \"One on One Again: An Evening of Festive Songs for the Season.\" Accompanied by the pianist Ian Fraser, Ms. Andrews will appear at 8 P.M. in the Old Whaler's Church on Union Street. \n\nThe concert will be preceded by a cocktail hour at a nearby private house and followed by a dinner, with Ms. Andrews as host, at the American Hotel.

The opera, conducted by Cal Stewart Kellogg and directed by Bodo Igesz, will be in Italian with English supertitles at 8 P.M. in Tilles Center on the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University in Brookville.\n\nPuccini's \"Boheme\" on March 19 and Verdi's \"Trovatore\" on May 14 complete the season (248-1040). \nHOUSE AND STUDIO TOURS\n\n The Three Village Historical Society holds its 15th Candlelight House Tour from noon to 6 P.M. on Saturday, when six houses in Setauket, Stony Brook, Old Field and Poquott are on a self-guided tour (751-3730).\n\nIn Sea Cliff, artisans and craftsmen in the Victorian village will open their studios and workshops from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturday for the 19th Arts and Crafts Tour, also self-guided.
