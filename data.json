Modern scholars believe it was a transitional period between winter and summer whose beginning was marked by cool, windy weather bearing the seductive hint of warm, ripe days to come. Days were apparently mild and balmy, evenings cool and fragrant with the aroma of a thousand blossoming trees and flowers.   The spring experienced by our remote ancestors bears nothing in common, needless to say, with the cruel tease that New Yorkers know today, a 10-day jolt of slashing rain that follows six weeks of meat-locker temperatures and howling Arctic winds, and raises the curtain on four months of blistering heat and 90 percent humidity. Spring in New York is a hoax. The city staggers into it like a man with a \"kick me\" sign tacked to his rear end. Chicago is spared this debacle, because it has no hope. It is a city that has grown accustomed to deep snowdrifts in Wrigley Field on opening day. New York still hopes.

The event emerges from the wreckage of the 92d Street Y's Schubertiade, a plan to present all of Schubert's music in chronological order over 10 seasons. That original format has been subverted by policy turmoils within the Y and survives only in altered form. Yet if Mr. Schiff's first concert, played before a packed house on a snow-blown Wednesday night, is an indication, this 18-sonata cycle surrounded by symposiums, master classes and film offerings, has found in defeat an unexpected triumph of its own.   Halfway through the evening, one felt the wisdom of, indeed a necessity for, placing these pieces side by side and separating them from the music of others. The sonatas operate according to laws of motion all their own, and listeners accustomed to urgency, dynamism, momentum and fixed destination needed time to adjust their inner clocks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930319","headline":"Indian Tribe's Lawsuit Freezes Property Owners' Land Titles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/nyregion/indian-tribe-s-lawsuit-freezes-property-owners-land-titles.html","abstract":"  Daniel and Charlotte Nyzio have lived in their Shelton Road home here for 29 years.

Their work brims with potential, even if it is not always entirely fulfilled.    Mr. McQueen's exhibition of 36 pieces traces a 15-year development in which the notion of basketry is applied more and more loosely and ingeniously. His oddly shaped works hover, often with great humor, in the gap between craft, sculpture and Conceptual Art. The least interesting pieces spell out words and poems with their forms or with the threads that hold them together, a habit that is a bit pretentious, especially when the results are illegible or nearly so; some of the best ironically recapitulate the compact roundness and raised mouths of Southwest Indian ceramic pots.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930319","headline":"COLLEGE BASKETBALL: Southeast; Seton Hall Confirms It's Bigger and Better Than Tennessee State","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/sports/college-basketball-southeast-seton-hall-confirms-it-s-bigger-better-than.html","abstract":"  As expected, Seton Hall cruised into the second round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament this evening.

Frank Baum's classic, \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\" it is an ebullient family crowd-pleaser. And a new production at the Beacon Theater, directed by George Faison and starring Stephanie Mills and Andre De Shields from the original Broadway cast, demonstrates that it doesn't take much to refresh the show, which ran on Broadway for four years. All that's needed is an infusion of contemporary slang and choreography (including a little Michael Jackson moonwalking and sexy L. L. Cool J-style pushups) to bring it up to date.   \"The Wiz\" takes a story so familiar that it doesn't have to be meticulously told to be followed, and reconceives it as a modern vaudeville entertainment with a pop-gospel score. The show is much jollier in tone than the movie \"The Wizard of Oz,\" which conveyed deep currents of Depression-era anxiety and longing for better times. Stephanie Mills's Dorothy has more pluck and brass than Judy Garland's waifish prairie dreamer. And while Ms. Mills's traveling companions on the Yellow Brick Road bemoan their lack of brains, heart and courage, the show's Scarecrow, Tinman and Lion are not so poignantly bereft of self-confidence as their movie counterparts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930319","headline":"Films From New Directors Taking Literary License","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/movies/films-from-new-directors-taking-literary-license.html","abstract":"  The New Directors/New Films series has existed for 22 years, but it has rarely if ever led off with the literary one-two punch of tonight's opening programs, \"Orlando\" and \"The Music of Chance.\"   Both films are adapted from the kind of serious novel that Hollywood has traditionally shunned as hopelessly highbrow and uncommercial. \"Orlando,\" the debut of Sally Potter, a 43-year-old English choregrapher turned director, is a cinematic realization of Virginia Woolf's classic 1928 novel. \"The Music of Chance,\" the first fictional feature by the documentary film maker Philip Haas, is an adaptation of a highly regarded metaphysical suspense novel, published in 1990 by the Brooklyn-based author Paul Auster.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930319","headline":"Stop Wasting Aid to Russia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/opinion/stop-wasting-aid-to-russia.html","abstract":"The world now looks toward Moscow with increasing trepidation.

Daniels, would be leaving the organization when his contract expires in June.   A statement released by the theater said Mr. Daniels, who has been the managerial and administrative head of Playwrights Horizons since 1981, was leaving \"to pursue other opportunities.\"   Neither Mr. Daniels nor the chairman of the board of trustees, Judith O. Rubin, returned phone messages this week. But the artistic director of Playwrights, Don Scardino, said in a careful phone interview that the move signaled a shakeup in the organization's two-pronged management structure. It was a year ago that Mr. Scardino, an actor and director in theater and film, replaced Andre Bishop, who had moved on to become artistic director at Lincoln Center Theater. Together, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Daniels had established a leadership team that apparently foundered after Mr. Bishop's departure. (Mr. Bishop, who remains a member of the Playwrights board, declined to comment on the matter, pleading awkwardness.)   Mr. Scardino said the search for Mr. Daniels's replacement had begun, but he added that two people might be hired: an executive director with fund-raising responsibility and a company manager whose bailiwick would be the administrative end of the theater's stage productions.    \"One of the things in question is whether the two-headed team is the best structure for us or not,\" Mr. Scardino said. \"I'm very much a group person. I'm a director who comes out of the rehearsal hall. I like a group dynamic and I'm not insecure about having someone disagree with me. One of the reasons I want to investigate the triumvirate is that you always have a tiebreaker.\"   It was already a somewhat tumultuous year at Playwrights Horizons, a 22-year-old group with two small theaters on West 42d Street that is dedicated to the development of new American plays and musicals. Mr. Scardino brought in a new associate artistic director, Nicholas Martin; as head of the board, Ms. Rubin is a recent replacement for Anne G. Wilder, who died in September.    Mr. Scardino's first year has been without any successes equal to the many renowned projects that have been born there in the past, including \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" and \"Sunday in the Park With George.\" It is, of course, early in his tenure, and he said the dismissal of JoAnne Akalaitis by the New York Shakespeare Festival board after only 20 months was baffling and troubling. \"She's not Joe Papp, and I'm not Andre Bishop,\" he said. \"How many years did it take for them to establish their identities?\"   In considering Mr. Daniels's departure, his own board, he said, had \"decided to let it happen and go with the art.\" He said he did not find the Shakespeare Festival situation comparable to that at Playwrights Horizons because \"one was about artistic change, and the other is about managerial change.\"   Asked if he and Mr. Daniels had clashed, Mr. Scardino said: \"There's a different sensibility guiding the company,\" and compared himself to a person who inherits someone else's wardrobe. \"This color was good for him,\" he said. \"This length was good for him. I'll wear it for a while, but eventually I've got to take it in. I like the suit, but I want it in blue.\" Speak No Evil    Unable to save \"Face Value,\" the producers simply saved face by declining to speak with reporters this week. (A man sounding a lot like Stuart Ostrow answered the phone at Mr. Ostrow's home, saying \"He'll have to get back to you\" and hanging up without waiting for the number.) David Henry Hwang's play about confused racial identities, which closed Sunday after a critically bruising tryout in Boston and eight previews at the Cort Theater, apparently never overcame a perception that the show was trying to do too much and ended up doing too little. Reviewers (and a sampling of the few other people who saw it) tended to say they couldn't tell if the show was a farce that wasn't funny or a serious play with too many goofy jokes.   Indeed, one source who was aware of the play's problems in Boston said that Rocco Landesman, a co-producer and president of Jujamcyn Theaters, had tried to persuade his colleagues, Mr. Ostrow and Scott Rudin, to close the show before it got here. Mr. Rudin and Mr. Ostrow said at the time, however, that they were undaunted, buoyed by the knowledge that Mr. Hwang's previous play, \"M. Butterfly,\" which became a Tony-winning hit, was also clobbered out of town. And Mr. Hwang (who, through the show's publicity agent, also declined to be interviewed) spent his days rewriting furiously, with the play changing nightly. One viewer who saw it in both cities said: \"In Boston, the first act was funny, and the second act was too serious.\" In New York, he added, they tried to prepare the audience for what was going to happen in the second act, and as a result the first act wasn't funny anymore.   From the point of view of a reporter who didn't see the play at all, the person who comes out of this best is the star, Mark Linn Baker. Mr. Baker, now an out-of-work actor possessed, apparently, of comic humility, donned a waiter's apron to introduce himself during one lunch hour at the West Bank Cafe on 42d Street this week. (It turns out he's part owner of the place.)   \"My understanding is they just ran out of money,\" Mr. Baker said. \"It was such an ambitious play. We knew before we started in Boston we had a lot of work to do.\"   He said there had been a celebratory wake, of sorts, for the show on Tuesday night at Wally and Joseph's, the steakhouse on West 49th Street. But he hadn't had a steak.   \"I was drinking kamikazes,\" he said. An 'Arf' for Off Broadway?    The corpse is twitching, though as Charles Strouse would rather put it, \"the body is breathing.\" Mr. Strouse, who wrote the music for the apparently ill-fated and moribund sequel \"Annie Warbucks,\" confirmed this week that many producers had come forward with an interest in resuscitating the show, the scheduled Broadway production of which was, pardon the expression, orphaned when it was shut down three weeks ago.   \"There are people who know there is money to be made on this,\" Mr. Strouse said. \"Even the stingiest investor knows there was profit of $300 million on 'Annie.' \"   Interestingly enough, among the offers is one to present the show Off Broadway. Though he refuses to acknowledge it publicly, Ben Sprecher, who operates the Variety Arts theater on Third Avenue and 14th Street, has been approaching investors with a proposal to open the show there. The Variety Arts, a 499-seat venue, is Off Broadway's most capacious theater.   \"I've been approached to produce 'Annie Warbucks' Off-Broadway,\" said Kenneth D. Greenblatt (\"Catskills on Broadway\"), adding it was Mr. Sprecher who did the approaching. \"It's under consideration. I like the project. Creatively I think it's wonderful. I'm just concerned about doing it Off Broadway for financial reasons.\"   Mr. Strouse said he'd definitely be interested. \"A way to get into the New York marketplace is something I want very much,\" he said.   Mr. Sprecher, when asked about his plans, said, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930319","headline":"Review/Film Festival; In a Weird City, Games Turn Serious","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/movies/review-film-festival-in-a-weird-city-games-turn-serious.html","abstract":"Beckett-like fable of bizarre plaything, two drifters and fate.

Because of a parade of rain delays, the day's first match, a quarterfinal between third-seeded Stefan Edberg and fifth-seeded Petr Korda, turned into a seven-hour ordeal that ended on an upset note, with Edberg the loser, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5). \"It's not a real contest when you come on and off the court five times,\" Edberg said. Gabriela Sabatini might have agreed after absorbing her worst loss to Steffi Graf in 34 meetings, 6-0, 6-2, a defeat that ended Sabatini's eight-match Florida winning streak against Graf.

Another men's quarterfinal saw Pete Sampras advance, 6-3, 7-6 (9-7), with some assistance from Richard Krajicek's double fault at matchpoint. Also reaching the semifinals was Marcos Ondruska, who eliminated Mark Woodforde, 6-4, 6-2, the conqueror of top-seeded Jim Courier on Thursday. HOCKEY Hartford Can Say Goodbye to Playoffs In Landover, Md., Dimitri Khristich scored two of his three goals during Washington's four-goal first period and the Capitals eliminated Hartford from playoff contention by beating the Whalers, 5-2, last night. The Whalers had not missed the playoffs since 1985, but the loss assured them of no better than a fifth-place finish in the Adams Division. Hartford is 29 points behind fourth-place Buffalo with 14 games to play. Washington, meanwhile, tightened its grasp on second place in the Patrick Division by winning for only the third time in 10 games. The Capitals lead the Rangers by 2 points and the New Jersey Devils by 3. Khristich completed his second career hat trick by scoring into the empty net with 1 minute 15 seconds left. His first three-goal game occurred Feb. 11 against St. Louis. (AP) HORSE RACING Alydeed Is Scratched, but Binalong Wins Alydeed, the favored Canadian colt, was scratched from the Gulfstream Park Sprint yesterday because the weight was too high and the track too wet. In his absence, Binalong, carrying 110 pounds, outran Loach to win the seven-furlong event by two lengths with a time of 1:221/5 . Roger Attfield, who trains Alydeed for the Kinghaven Farm, reported that his star was healthy, but added: \"I was a little concerned about the weight of 123 pounds just 13 days after running such a huge race off the layoff. I knew the track was bad this morning, and I definitely didn't want him to run on it.\"   Attfield referred to the fact that Alydeed didn't race from last September until March 6, when he won a sizzling sprint over Fly So Free. He conceded that he had been prompted by the loss this week of another of his star horses, St. Jovite, the European champion, who was suddenly retired after he injured a tendon while working out. The trainer said that Alydeed would start in the Breeders' Cup Commonwealth at Keeneland on April 13 and then in New York in May in the Carter and the Metropolitan Mile.

is no wonder choreographers love to tell stories that keep moving by means of tragic blunders or comic misadventures. And by creating full-evening ballets, choreographers can spin rousing narratives on the grandest of scales.    The trouble is, they keep telling the same stories. They borrow from Shakespeare and other literary classics, or they choose a well-known fairy tale. The results are often bores -- epic bores. A dull one-act ballet will come to an end in, say, half an hour. But a lackluster full-evening work natters on for act after act. Who needs another plodding \"Romeo and Juliet,\" simpering \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" or saccharine \"Cinderella\"?

He never had to contend with music critics. If he had, some would undoubtedly have found his lyre playing cool, unemotional, uninvolved.

Mr. Pollini, who will give his final New York recital of the season on Saturday evening at Carnegie Hall, seems to have cornered the market in qualified adulation.   \"Technically, he already plays better than any of us on the jury,\" said Arthur Rubinstein, setting the tone for later commentary in 1960, when the 18-year-old Mr. Pollini won the Chopin Competition in Warsaw. Praise for Mr. Pollini's godlike technique in the decades since has been virtually unanimous, but at least in the United States, many have found the pianist wanting in the temperament, flair and sensibility of the great virtuosos of the first half of the century, exemplified most recently by Vladimir Horowitz.

Built in a bloated and awkward neo-classical style at a time -- the 1840's and 50's -- when neo-classicism no longer came naturally, it manages to look at the same time too big and oddly shrunken, in part because the flattened dome sits so unpleasantly on the rest of the church.

On April 1, Rail Europe, the marketing arm of the European railroads in the United States and Canada, will start selling the Russian Flexipass. It will provide unlimited rail travel on major routes for any four days in a 15-day period at a cost of $298 a person in first class, $198 in second class. Additional days may be purchased at $65 a day in first class, $40 a day in second class.   By combining the new Russian Flexipass with a Eurail Flexipass, for example, travelers could go from Shannon, Ireland, to Vladivostok, on the Pacific coast of Russia. The trip between Shannon and Helsinki could be made on a five-day Eurail Flexipass, the rest of the journey on the new Russian Flexipass with a one-day extension. The approximate rail price for the 10-day trip would be $661 in first class and $458 for second class, a Rail Europe spokesman said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Money Doesn't Buy Misery for Indians' Lofton","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/sports/on-baseball-money-doesn-t-buy-misery-for-indians-lofton.html","abstract":"  As reporters approached, the young player rested his arms on his knees and hung his head, the body language screaming \"go away.\"   Looks were exchanged and thoughts telegraphed instantly: another pro athlete has a major A, as in attitude, part of the sometimes seething class warfare that is waged more and more between the young and the richest and those charged with chronicling their every move. \"Ken,\" one reporter said, surrender in the air. \"Can we talk to you?\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Stalin in the Laboratory","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/books/stalin-in-the-laboratory.html","abstract":"SCIENCE IN RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET UNION\n\nA Short History.\nBy Loren R.

Rather it aspires to demonstrate, in the ambitious, quasi-sociological manner of the newer art history, \"what portraiture meant in terms of 18th-century English culture and society.\" As Marcia Pointon shows in her highly discerning discussions of several \"conversation pieces\" (a favorite 18th-century subgenre that depicted placid family groups in domestic settings), portraits served as \"a form of quasi-legal genealogical statement\" for both the aristocracy and the gentry. One chapter of \"Hanging the Head\" is devoted to the physical location of portraits, establishing how and where they were hung (hence the rather awkward title). Elsewhere Ms. Pointon, who teaches art history at the University of Manchester, considers portraiture as a trade, \"a highly developed business in a buyer's market,\" detailing how even successful portrait painters were forced to endure the almost unbelievable arrogance and penuriousness of aristocratic patrons. The oddest but not the least fascinating chapter, entitled \"Dangerous Excrescences: Wigs, Hair and Masculinity,\" sets forth in extraordinary detail the fetishistic significance of the wigs seen in so many portraits of 18th-century gentlemen. When Ms. Pointon does pause to scrutinize individual works -- a series of portraits of prepubescent girls, portraits of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in Turkish dress -- her analyses can be brilliant and arrestingly phrased.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Fire Safety Laws Need Strengthening","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/nyregion/l-fire-safety-laws-need-strengthening-177393.html","abstract":"  I read with interest your article \"After a Fireman Dies, Questions About Staffing and Equipment\"  [ March 7 ] , about the tragic death of the White Plains firefighter Warren Ogburn, who died during a blaze at Grant Manor, the high-rise apartment at South Lexington and Maple Avenues in White Plains.

The 28-year-old world champion scored 10-3 in the elite invitational competition, which included an imposing selection of his chief rivals.   Kasparov's prize came to less than $10,000, a paltry amount for such an important event. But that does not tell all: the real money in Linares is in the appearance fees, and these are kept secret.  FINAL STANDINGS        Player   Pts.                     Kasparov   10        Karpov   8 1/2        V. Anand   8 1/2        A. Shirov   8        V. Kramnik   7 1/22        V. Salov   6 1/2        V.

Ljubojevic   4         Kasparov's tremendous skill in attacking shone forth in his Round 10 victory over the former world champion Anatoly Karpov of Russia.   The first surprise was Kasparov's recapture, 10 . . . Ne5!?, which amounted to a sacrifice of the d6 pawn -- on 11 b3 Ne8, there would have come 12 c5!   On 13 . . . Nfd7, Karpov could not develop with 14 Ng3? Nf3 15 gf Bc3. And 14 Bd4 Re8 (threatening 15 . . . Bf8!) 15 Be5 Re5 16 Qc6 Ra6 17 Rd7 Qe8! 18 Qc7 Bd7 is lost for White because his tiny material advantage is no compensation for Black's enormous lead in development. Karpov tried 14 f4, but Kasparov struck back sharply with 14 . . . b4!, one point being that accepting the second pawn offer with 15 Qb4 would have allowed 15 . . . c5! 16 Bc5 Nc5! 17 Rd8 Ned3 18 Kd2 Nb4 19 Rf8 Kf8, winning a piece for two pawns.   And, on 15 Na4, Kasparov would have had 15 . . . Ra4! 16 ba Nc4 17 Qd3 Nb2 18 Qc2 Nd1 19 Qd1 Qa5 20 Kf2 Nf6 21 Ng3 Ng4 with strong attacking chances.   Karpov tried 21 h4 in the hope of getting his KR to help out with 22 Rh3, but Kasparov sacrificed a pawn to open lines with 21 . . . c4! (22 bc? would permit 22 . . . b3! followed by 23 . . . Qa5).   After 22 Nc1, Kasparov charged in with 22 . . . c3! 23 Na2 c2. Had Karpov defended by 24 Rc1, there could have followed 24 . . . cb/Q 25 Rb1 Ne5! 26 Rd1 (26 Qe3 Ng4!) Qa5 27 fe Qa2 28 Qe3 Nc3 29 Rc1 Re8 30 Rc3 bc 31 Qc3 Bg4 32 Bd3 Rc8 33 Bc4 Qb1, winning a rook.   Perhaps the most remarkable twist of Kasparov's onslaught was that, after 24 Qd4 cd/Q 25 Kd1 (25 Qd1 Qb6 is a nightmare for White), he forced the exchange of queens by 25 . . . Ndc5! 26 Qd8 Rd8 without giving up anything of his mighty momentum.    After 27 Kc2 (27 Ke1 Bg4! 28 Be2 Be2 29 Ke2 Ng3 garners a rook) Nf2, Karpov overstepped the time limit. That spared him the agony of 28 Rg1 Bf5 29 Kb2 Rd1.

That's the hidden message behind the conspicuously awful haircuts of some current leading men. An actor with bad hair is the equivalent of an actress doing an unglamorous turn (think of Cher looking plain in \"Moonstruck\") -- a sign he cares so much about his art, he's willing to ugly up. Here is a sampler of top stars who have been acting with their hair. Michael Douglas in \"Falling Down\" -- The nerd du jour look says emphatically that this is    not    Michael Douglas, sex symbol. No nude posteriors, no ice picks. The seriously bad hair also says that this is a movie with a message, though the message may be that Mr. Douglas is paying homage to. . . Al Pacino in \"The Godfather Part III\" -- This is the haircut that was so distracting, some people couldn't pay attention to the movie. Who knows why the aging Michael Corleone got a spiky brush-cut? Maybe the porcupine look was supposed to keep rival families away. Kevin Costner in \"The Bodyguard\" -- This cut perpetuates the myth that secret service agents have to look as conspicuous as possible. Some people have speculated that this bad hair is an homage to Steve McQueen, for whom the movie was originally written. More likely it is an homage to . . .  Harrison Ford in \"Presumed Innocent\" -- There are two possible explanations for this cut. As a dedicated lawyer, the Ford character wants to look like Julius Caesar. Or, the hair is a red herring, deflecting attention from the true murderer and any holes in the plot.  Robert De Niro in \"Mad Dog and Glory\" -- Sometimes he gains 50 pounds to play a role. Sometimes he gets his hair cut the way it must have looked in third grade. Living with this 'do inspired him in playing the meek, mild-mannered Mad Dog. Robin Williams in \"Toys\" -- No, he isn't entering a Barry Manilow look-alike contest. The dyed-blond hair suggests a man so in touch with his inner child that his hair has never darkened. Or, maybe he's just trying to look like Rod Stewart. Sean Connery in \"Medicine Man\" -- In this classic hair strategy, the ponytail compensates for a receding hairline. The character, a scientist who has spent years in the jungle, could be an aging hippy, or a SoHo art dealer who hasn't heard that the 80's are over.

Later, when residents of Japanese descent were forced into internment camps during World War II, their homes and business in what was then known as Little Osaka were lost to them. And in the 1950's and early 60's, Fillmore below California Street served as the heart of the African-American community until redevelopment ripped apart the neighborhood, tearing down acres of Victorian houses and transforming the jazz clubs and rib joints into boarded-up storefronts and vacant lots.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"In the Region: Long Island; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/realestate/in-the-region-long-island-recent-sales-796993.html","abstract":"  Albertson  $223,500   140 Albertson Parkway  4-bedroom, 1-bath, 40-year-old Cape Cod; dining room, eat-in kitchen, finished basement, gas heat; taxes $3,400.

(Vintage International, $10.) This novel, set in the 19th century, shows how the lives of two very different people -- the daughter of a West Indian plantation owner and one of his slaves -- become entwined in a tragedy. Last year our reviewer, George Garrett, said that with this book the author \"takes a firm step toward joining the company of the literary giants of our time.\"     THE MISMEASURE OF WOMAN, by Carol Tavris. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $13.) Women are neither worse nor better than men, argues the social psychologist Carol Tavris. She examines the fallacies inherent in much of the research comparing the sexes, and concludes that while women and men often do different things, their dissimilar behavior does not translate into differences in ability. \"The great virtue of this book is that its author never confuses the very real differences in women's and men's experiences -- pregnancy and childbearing being the most obvious -- with the cultural artifacts surrounding these undeniable facts of life,\" Susan Jacoby said here last year. Also out in paperback is THE WAR AGAINST WOMEN (Ballantine, $12), in which Marilyn French documents the institutional and cultural weapons used to perpetuate female inequality in both Western and third world nations. Last year our reviewer, Isabelle de Courtivron, called it \"a sobering reminder that the situation of women may still be so universally abysmal that if any other ethnic, national or religious group were attacked, dominated and maimed at the same rate, it could be said to constitute a state of emergency or war.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"How Violence Moved Center Stage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/nyregion/theater-how-violence-moved-center-stage.html","abstract":"  FIRST you wince.

Just having fun isn't enough; there has to be a fillip of transgression, too, a feeling of deliberately and deliciously breaking some rule. Those who worry that therapeutic ideas and other secular-humanist notions have dispelled old feelings of sinfulness can take some comfort in the continuing popularity of Depeche Mode, a band that finds fear in every desire and temptation in every fear. \"I give in to sin,\" the song \"Strangelove\" proclaimed in 1987, \"because you have to make this life livable.\" But that doesn't prevent the band from agonizing over every passion on its new album, \"Songs of Faith and Devotion\" (Mute/Sire 4-45243; CD and cassette).    Depeche Mode, an English band whose name is French for \"fast fashion,\" has become hugely popular, filling concert halls with screaming black-clad teen-age girls while going nearly unnoticed among people over 25. At times, the group is just an inflection away from parody. David Gahan, the singer, is a baritone crooner dispensing the emotional signals -- the breathy importunings, the broad vibrato -- of a particularly self-important lounge act; the music has an echoing grandiosity that verges on melodrama. Yet that very solemnity assures adolescent listeners that others understand their private and encompassing dilemmas, providing a kind of consolation.

But for how long? Some maintain that Trollope began to be widely read again only after the pioneering work of Michael Sadleir, his biographer and bibliographer, in the 1920's. Others assert that the real revival came during World War II, when nostalgia for the \"peaceful world\" of his novels brought solace to war-ravaged Britain. Still others believe he has been resurrected only lately, through the television serialization of the Palliser novels in the 1970's and of the Barchester novels in the 1980's. And some date the Trollope revival from the founding of the London-based Trollope Society in 1987, an organization that has successfully lobbied for Trollope's entry into Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. \n\nActually, these explanations have it wrong. The activities of Sadleir, the television series and the Trollope Society, while they helped to increase Trollope's readership, for the most part reflected his popularity rather than created it. The only accurate gauge of a writer's popularity is publishers' sales. The pronouncements of \"experts,\" academics or critics, are really not worth much. Publishers bring out books to sell them; and when books sell well, publishers issue new printings and editions. For the last century, while many critics relegated Trollope to a secondary position among the major British novelists, publishers have been printing his books to wide and steady markets.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Queens Commuters' Gift: Free Transfers on Buses","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/nyregion/queens-commuters-gift-free-transfers-on-buses.html","abstract":"  Hoping to address a longstanding complaint about mass transit in Queens, the Dinkins administration announced on Friday that it would soon allow commuters in the borough to transfer free from city buses to private ones.

But a close reading of the copies of complaints that readers send to hotels, cruise lines and tour companies shows that most have not been effective: They are already in round 2 or 3 and have not got what they want. In fact, they often have not specified what they want, which is a major mistake.    To recast the line about how crucial location is in real estate, the three most important aspects of complaining are timing, timing and timing. A complaint must be lodged while something can be done to make things right because, as one tour executive put it, money does not replace lost vacation time. A letter sent a month after a traveler returns from a trip is less likely to get results than a phone call made on the spot, saying, for example, that a hotel does not correspond to the description in the brochure. When the issue is services not provided, delay may make it impossible for management to track down who did not do what for whom.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Anna McCain, William Madonia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/style/engagements-anna-mccain-william-madonia.html","abstract":"  Thomas T.
