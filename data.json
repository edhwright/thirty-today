Thomas Stacy, the Philharmonic's longtime English horn player, to whom the Rorem work was dedicated, was the soloist.   The new concerto brought the unsurprising news that Mr. Rorem had stayed true to the Romantic American style he inherited from Barber and Copland. His spacious, ambling, tonally centered musical vocabulary sometimes comes perilously close to American kitsch -- what I think of as apple-orchard music -- until an impressionistic twist of harmony averts disaster. Melodies unspool at an even quarter-note pace, and not much happens to them once they are complete. Developmental logic is discreetly absent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940129","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/29/arts/classical-music-in-review-024503.html","abstract":"  'Jerusalem' The New York Grand Opera Carnegie Hall","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940129","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/29/us/inside-016888.html","abstract":"    Economy Grew Strongly In Final Quarter of '93   The economy surged at a 5.9 percent annual pace in the final quarter of 1993, the best performance in six years.

Ms. Reno's aides said today that she had lost patience with Mr. Heymann's approach and was concentrating on finding a decisive, seasoned professional to succeed him.

Each slip-up seems to have its own rationale, and delay in completing background checks on nominees is an all-purpose excuse. But the signs point to Attorney General Janet Reno and to the White House, where the buck is supposed to stop. Indeed, the Justice Department seems to be the most disorganized agency in an Administration not exactly known for precision management.    The abrupt resignation of Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann after only nine months is another setback. Mr. Heymann, a respected legal educator and seasoned criminal law administrator, was challenged to end the department's headless drift. Now faulty \"chemistry\" requires his departure and reopens holes in top management. Coherent leadership still seems far in the future. Ms. Reno's supporters say she found him too dilatory.

It's still cold and still half-French: Ottawa is one of the world's most northerly capitals, and its citizens make bilingualism sound impressively effortless. But the \"difficult to stir\" part is being re-evaluated, because the formerly stodgy city looks increasingly lively.\n\nIt has always been picturesque, particularly in winter. When the Rideau Canal freezes (at about 4.5 miles, it's billed as \"the world's longest skating rink\"), Ottawa looks like a Ruritanian dream capital, peopled by happy bureaucrats skating their way to work in neo-Gothic Parliament buildings. To the north, on Nepean Point, the glassy National Gallery shines like a gigantic ice sculpture. But even skating civil servants cannot subsist on mere charm, and every year they find more diversions, better restaurants, more sophisticated shopping in Ottawa. One of those diversions, Winterlude (more poetically called Bal de Neige, or Snow Ball, in French) has been providing cold-weather denial or festivity, depending on how you look at it, since 1979. Winterlude this year comes with a coda -- an extra weekend (Feb. 18 to 20) after the festival's normal 10-day span (Feb. 4 to 13). The posters enjoin, \"Don't Hibernate, Come Celebrate,\" and last year 400,000 visitors complied, taking part in more than 100 activities spread over seven sites in Ottawa and across the Ottawa River in the province of Quebec.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"Alden Jones, Richard Perkins 3d","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/style/weddings-alden-jones-richard-perkins-3d.html","abstract":"  Alden Landry Jones, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Graham E.

They will read from copies of \"Ulysses,\" listen to music composed by Joyce, hear his voice on recordings, join impromptu discussions of the man and his work, watch screenings of three Joycean films and consume copious amounts of Irish soda bread and tea.   The films are: \"The Dead,\" based on Joyce's short story, directed by John Huston and starring Anjelica Huston, to be shown at 11 A.M.; \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\" screened at 2 P.M. with John Gielgud in a fiery bit as Joyce's priest, and \"James Joyce's Women,\" with Fionnula Flanagan portraying the key women in Joyce's life at 7 P.M.   Following the last film, the shop's owners, Lila and Marshall Cohen, will serve their traditional Joyce birthday cake, on which the first page of \"Ulysses\" has been reproduced in chocolate and white icing.   Everything is free. The number for more information is 644-9979.

And if you should travel afterward to the west of Ireland you may surprise and please the residents with your smattering of their own tongue. \"There are many people who still speak Gaelic among themselves, but they switch to English with strangers because nobody else understands it,\" Mr. Cronin said.   Classes begin this Wednesday from 7:30 to 9 P.M. and continue weekly through the end of May at Trinity Catholic High School on Newfield Avenue in Stamford. Attendance at 12 classes costs $35, and the textbook, \"Irish for Everyone\" by Brother Charles Quinn of Iona College, New Rochelle, is an additional $10.

East of the rocky, wave-lashed shore the sage green mountains roll, sequestering Big Sur from the rest of the world. In the dark canyons between them, streams lined with groves of towering redwoods flow toward the sea. Highway 1, that daredevil of a road, skitters along the Big Sur coast, punctuated by perilously perched bridges and vertiginous views.\n\nMost of this approximately 192,000-acre area belongs to the federally administered Los Padres National Forest, though five state parks and reserves dot the coast. The rest is owned by Big Sur's 1,200 residents. I drove down from San Francisco on a sunny, 55-degree December afternoon, on Highway 1 all the way. The trip took three and a half hours in a car I rented at Alamo in the city for $42.25 a day; I could have done better by taking an economy-class car, but I opted for a compact-class Chevrolet Cavalier because I wanted to be sure I'd have the power needed for driving on rough dirt roads.

After a mediocre regular season, in which he threw 18 interceptions, Kelly has had two strong performances in the playoffs. Troy Aikman threw just six interceptions this season. He left last week's game with a concussion. But if he is 100 percent, he is more dangerous than his counterpart. Edge: Cowboys.   RUNNING BACKS Emmitt Smith has won three straight rushing titles, but has been slowed recently by a separated shoulder. Thurman Thomas rushed for 186 yards in the A.F.C. championship game. Edge: Bills.   RECEIVERS The Bills' Billy Brooks, Andre Reed and Don Beebe do not match the explosiveness of Dallas's Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper. Edge: Cowboys.   OFFENSIVE LINE Two big, powerful groups that like crushing opposing defensive fronts. The Cowboys averaged 135.1 yards per game rushing in the regular season, and the Bills averaged 121.4 yards a game. The Cowboys' line, in particular, has provided Aikman with excellent protection. assing and just six interceptions thrown. Edge: Cowboys.   DEFENSIVE LINE Bills defensive end Bruce Smith had a strong season, with 14 sacks and 24 quarterback pressures. But his greatness has become expected, so what he did went relatively unnoticed. Cowboys defensive end Charles Haley has a bad back and if he plays, he will be limited. The Cowboys are very quick and strong and come with a ton of pressure. Edge: Bills.   LINEBACKERS Marvcus Patton and Mark Maddox have given the Bills some aggressiveness and hard hitting in the middle. Add Cornelius Bennett and Darryl Talley on the outside and you have trouble. Dallas middle linebacker Ken Norton has played much of the season with a torn bicep. Edge: Bills.   SECONDARY Cornerback Kevin Smith, whose six interceptions were the second highest in the N.F.C., and safety Thomas Everett give the Dallas unit the bite to back up their bark. Bills safety Henry Jones is a versatile player who could draw some responsibility for trying to stop Emmitt Smith. Edge: Cowboys.   SPECIAL TEAMS Buffalo's Danny Copeland is a tough kick returner who has run back a punt for a touchdown this year. And Steve Tasker is a perennial All-Pro. Dallas's Kevin Williams is a dangerous performer who returned two punts for touchdowns this year. Playing in the Georgia Dome should not have a bearing on the field-goal attempts by Buffalo's Steve Christie or Dallas's Eddie Murray. Edge: Cowboys.   COACHES Marv Levy has overcome three previous Super Bowl losses to get his team in a position for one more shot. Unfortunately, on Super Bowl Day, there is always a short-circuit with the Bills' game plan. Dallas's Jimmy Johnson excels at having his team mentally and physically prepared for big games. And in football there are none bigger than the Super Bowl. Edge: Cowboys.   OVER ALL If the Bills can stay away from turnovers, they have a shot to stay close. The Bills bring an awful lot of baggage to this game, and it will be hard for them to unload it unless they have a big lead going into the fourth quarter. That probably won't happen.

It's still cold and still half-French: Ottawa is one of the world's most northerly capitals, and its citizens make bilingualism sound impressively effortless. But the \"difficult to stir\" part is being re-evaluated, because the formerly stodgy city looks increasingly lively.\n\nIt has always been picturesque, particularly in winter. When the Rideau Canal freezes (at about 4.5 miles, it's billed as \"the world's longest skating rink\"), Ottawa looks like a Ruritanian dream capital, peopled by happy bureaucrats skating their way to work in neo-Gothic Parliament buildings.

A new retrospective that opened on Friday at the Museum of Modern Art, \"Gaumont Presents: A Century of French Cinema,\" offers American audiences strong evidence that the French may be right.    The idea for this series of 50 programs, running through April 14, had its genesis when Laurence Kardish, curator of film at the museum, began looking for a way to mark the centennial of cinema. (Most film historians regard 1895 as the birth of the movies.) Mr. Kardish and his colleagues immediately thought of France, given its importance to the medium's artistic and commercial development. Fortuitously, they were approached at the same time by the venerable French film company Gaumont, which agreed to pay for the show. Gaumont opened its archives, and Mr. Kardish and the co-curator of the retrospective, Edith Kramer, director of the Pacific Film Archives in Berkeley, Calif., made their selections.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"Latvians Appeal to U.S. for Assurances on Russia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/world/latvians-appeal-to-us-for-assurances-on-russia.html","abstract":"  In the face of growing tensions with Russia, leaders of Latvia's Parliament will travel to Washington this weekend to seek American assurances over a compromise mediated by the United States that is intended to speed the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia.

A decade later Wright won the commission for the Imperial Hotel, perhaps as a result of his interest in things Japanese or the apparent affinity of his style with Japan's traditional buildings.

Encouraged to expand his research into a doctoral dissertation, Mr. Howarth did so and went further: His biography, \"Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Modern Movement,\" was published in 1952.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"Cousteau, at 83, Emphasizes the Most Important Species: Mankind","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/world/cousteau-at-83-emphasizes-the-most-important-species-mankind.html","abstract":"  When a wave of explosives, bags of pesticide and drums of acetone washed ashore after recent storms, France turned to the man who has long acted as the conscience of the sea.

As if it were a show that had been put together by the man considered to be the greatest producer in Broadway's history, what appears at first blush to be just another coffeetable extravaganza proves far more substantial than its opulent illustrations and lavish packaging might suggest. Richard and Paulette Ziegfeld persuasively argue that Ziegfeld was more than just an extravagant showman; he was also an artist who \"raised the revue form progressively from burlesque to vaudeville to art.\" Ziegfeld began his legendary career in 1893 by promoting Sandow, a circus strongman, in his native Chicago. Within a few years Ziegfeld had settled in New York, where he produced more than 80 shows before his death in 1932 at the age of 65. From the start, the authors write, his shows flirted with \"the bounds of propriety\" and \"prompted talk about vulgarity,\" but in the end \"his ability to meld the best of both high and low cultures\" had permanently shaped the course of the American theater. In addition to \"The Ziegfeld Follies,\" his annual signature offering, Ziegfeld produced a wide variety of plays and musical diversions, often showcasing his many mistresses or his long-suffering second wife, Billie Burke. In the same way that Ziegfeld provided more than simply the titillation his works were famous for, the authors' early peekaboo treatment of Ziegfeld's notorious womanizing and gambling gives way to a deeperanalysis of what such behavior entailed. The book has many revealing anecdotes, and a veritable who's who of the American theater parades through these pages just as it paraded through Ziegfeld's life.

It's still cold and still half-French: Ottawa is one of the world's most northerly capitals, and its citizens make bilingualism sound impressively effortless. But the \"difficult to stir\" part is being re-evaluated, because the formerly stodgy city looks increasingly lively.\n\nIt has always been picturesque, particularly in winter. When the Rideau Canal freezes (at about 4.5 miles, it's billed as \"the world's longest skating rink\"), Ottawa looks like a Ruritanian dream capital, peopled by happy bureaucrats skating their way to work in neo-Gothic Parliament buildings. To the north, on Nepean Point, the glassy National Gallery shines like a gigantic ice sculpture. But even skating civil servants cannot subsist on mere charm, and every year they find more diversions, better restaurants, more sophisticated shopping in Ottawa.

In an effort to lower statistics for crimes in all age groups and combat the growing numbers of youth crimes, local police departments are stepping up patrols of officers on the beat.

Last year our reviewer, Robert Kuttner, called it \"an engrossing discussion of the nuances and politics of school reform.\"  FRAUD By Anita Brookner. Vintage Contemporaries, $11. Anna Durrant is a middle-aged woman who has sacrificed her youth to care for others, notably her mother. After this parent finally dies, Anna disappears, an event that mirrors the emotional disintegration she has been suffering for years. Anita Brookner's revelation of where Anna is -- and where she has been -- makes for \"an immensely satisfying novel with unsettling insights into what can happen when the boundaries between aging parents and their children dissolve,\" Ursula Hegi said here last year. Vintage has also reissued Ms. Brookner's earlier novel PROVIDENCE ($10), about a female professor in England who believes more in romantic love than in religion.

It was, in part, an international exposition: pop-flamenco from the Spanish guitarist Rene Heredia, booming and strutting traditional drum music from Les Percussions de Guinea; a bass solo by Armand Sabal-Lecco, from Cameroon; and subtle, propulsive pieces by Uakti, who nearly stole the show with the novel sounds of homemade instruments.

It was the last World Cup race before the start of the Lillehammer Olympics in Norway on Feb. 12. Myler, fifth at the 1992 Olympics, finished with a combined 1 minute 28.284 seconds, followed by Jan Bode of Germany with 1:28.400 and Doris Neuner of Austria with 1:28.501. (AP) GOLF  Senior Skins to Floyd  Raymond Floyd, who didn't earn a cent the first day of the Senior Skins, made up for it yesterday, winning $240,000 and the four-man tournament title at Mauna Lani, Hawaii. The two-time defending champion, Arnold Palmer, finished second with $115,000 in earnings, including $70,000 on the final day. Lee Trevino, the first-day leader with $80,000, failed to win a hole on the second.

Jansen, of Greenfield, Wis., was clocked at 35.76 seconds in breaking his world record of 35.92 seconds, set Dec. 4 in Hamar, Norway. It was the sixth time Jansen either set or tied the world 500-meter mark. The three-time Olympic gold medalist, Bonnie Blair, of Champaign, Ill., won all four races she skated during the two-day competition and set a world points record to win her first world championship since 1989. Jansen was fourth to Kevin Scott of Canada in the 1,000-meter event, but combined with Blair to win the individual championships.

The working group labored, and came up with a draft executive order last November, which (naturally) was kept secret. Fortunately, a copy was leaked to the Federation of American Scientists. And lo, the federation found that while suggesting a few modest reforms, the draft order would actually close the shutters tighter.    The draft order proposes, with a few exceptions, a maximum classification lifetime of 40 years. As the federation's analysts point out, Richard Nixon set a maximum of 30 years for most classified documents, and Jimmy Carter fixed the limit at 20 years.

Baseball owners and officials who were reached over the weekend either said they didn't know White's status or, if they knew, declined to clarify it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940131","headline":"Giuliani Plan For Hospitals Facing Fight","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/31/nyregion/giuliani-plan-for-hospitals-facing-fight.html","abstract":"  Mayor Rudolph W.
