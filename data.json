In the upside-down world of alternative rock, however, pretending to hate the business is the best way to get it to come to you. And Catherine certainly has all the ingredients that go into making a good alternative rock band. It may even have too many. It produced its five-song album \"Sleepy\" (TVT) with Billy Corgan, who leads Chicago's biggest current success story, the Smashing Pumpkins. It also shares a bottom-heavy rock esthetic with the Smashing Pumpkins; Mark Rew sings in a raspy, self-mocking growl reminiscent of Kurt Cobain. And as proved by the band's bad jokes on Wednesday, it has trouble communicating directly with its audience, in the manner of Mr. Corgan and Mr. Cobain.   Catherine played few songs with many parts. Songs usually began as slow, winsome rock ballads and after a screeching guitar solo, turned into heavy rockers and finally all-out noise made by three guitars squealing, scraping and clanging in unison. Catherine's music was as ambivalent as the band's relationship to success: it seduced and then repelled.

But both believe that the world trade pact that the U.S. and 116 other nations recently signed and is now before Congress would be a mistake. This political odd couple is mainly worried about a new institution, the World Trade Organization, that would oversee fair-trade rules. Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan see the organization as a threat to U.S. sovereignty -- subjecting health, safety and environmental laws to overthrow by secretive tribunals in which the U.S. would carry no more weight than, say, Sri Lanka.    The Clinton Administration retorts, correctly, that the Trade Organization has no legal power to change U.S. law. Moreover, the trade pact itself would do far more good than bad -- adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy over the next several years. Still, the criticisms contain a kernel of truth that deserves to be acknowledged.

Patrons and Projects, 1892-1912 (Yale University, $60). The author, an assistant curator of European painting at the Art Institute of Chicago, examines Vuillard's work during the two decades in which he created decorative panels and screens for some of his affluent patrons. His first efforts, for a Paris industrialist, established many of the themes Vuillard (1868-1940) would explore in his subsequent decorations: domestic scenes on a terrace, vignettes in a dressmaking studio, images of nursemaids with children in public gardens. Ms. Groom stresses that perhaps more than the choice of subject or format, Vuillard's use of distemper -- a technique requiring the fast and arduous application of a mixture of glue and pigment to obtain a tapestrylike surface -- signaled his concern for the decorative qualities of his work and helped to change ideas about interior decoration and modern esthetics. The book is profusely illustrated with color reproductions not only of Vuillard's work but also of paintings by contemporaries like Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Claude Monet. Sure-footed and fluid, Ms. Groom's highly informative study gives Vuillard's sophisticated decorations the recognition they deserve.

The area encompasses London's financial district, including the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street, which has its own museum, the Guildhall, and the Lloyd's of London building. Tourist attractions such as St. Paul's Cathedral and the Barbican Center are on the edge of the area affected by the plan.    The aim of the program is to reroute through traffic onto the City's main roads, leaving the side streets free for essential local traffic only. The core of the City's street pattern has survived since medieval times and many of the streets are very narrow, winding between historic buildings. The restrictions limit access to this area to eight routes, one of which is for buses and taxis only. Some 20 intersections have been closed.

This is an enormous understatement.   Glen Canyon was the largest and most spectacular slickrock canyon system on the Colorado Plateau, a deep, remote, enormous expanse of wilderness. Now under a thousand feet of water and mud in its main channel, it has been reduced to a boat pond and motor resort (treated, as the author pointed out, with contempt by resort owners who have been tossing boat batteries in its waters for years). Many of us who know and love the Colorado Plateau's wilderness feel very bitter about the atrocity known as \"Lake Foul,\" and about the damming of a place whose very wildness and remoteness made it politically defenseless back in the early 60's. To extoll the beauties of the cliffs of Lake Powell without considering what lies underneath the waters, the mud and the engine batteres is akin (using a well-worn analogy) to touring a purposely flooded cathedral and admiring the accessibility of its ceilings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"The Nueva Basque Cuisine of San Sebastian","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/travel/choice-tables-the-nueva-basque-cuisine-of-san-sebastian.html","abstract":"  SAN Sebastian is a small, elegant seaside resort that feels frozen in time.

Edited by Nicholas Wade, Cornelia Dean and William A. Dicke. (Times Books/Random House, $25.) Scarcely any discipline makes the concerned lay reader feel more helpless than the environmental sciences. Everything is connected to everything else: air-conditioning in Texas causes skin cancer in Kazakhstan; whatever anybody does makes everything worse. \"The Environment From Your Backyard to the Ocean Floor\" means to help. It is based principally on articles that appeared in The New York Times from 1990 to 1993; its editors say it is intended to provide readers an understanding of environmental issues by focusing \"on the science that provides, or should provide, the framework for political discussion.\" Its 112 articles explore such recent newsworthy subjects as pollution in the former Communist nations, the perils of intelligence to parrots, the dangers of stocking game fish and the contribution of lawn mowers to smog. Threats and disasters occupy most of the book, but interesting sections are devoted to the economic consequences of ecological studies, reassessments of previously identified menaces, and the possible restoration of damaged ecosystems.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"Capitalist Country Fair","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/style/evening-hours-capitalist-country-fair.html","abstract":"  Mixing business with pleasure and charity, Forbes estate, July 16.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"The Heart Of the Zulu Kingdom","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/travel/the-heart-of-the-zulu-kingdom.html","abstract":"  THE battlefield of Isandlwana has not changed much since the day in 1879 when the British redcoats suffered one of the most humiliating defeats of their imperial history.

The piece, by the Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, had disappeared from public view for 60 years. Then, three months ago, the museum acquired it at a London auction for $365,000. And two years from now, the washstand will be part of the first Mackintosh retrospective in 25 years and the largest show of his works ever held. After the show opens in Glasgow it will travel to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.    Mackintosh, underappreciated at the turn of the century and impoverished at his death at age 60 in 1928, is having a good year. Within the last six months alone, two collections of his works have been auctioned in London for high prices; a desk brought a record $1.2 million at Christie's in February, and the washstand sold for six times the expected amount at Sotheby's in April.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"Rise in Hoax Calls Tests Coast Guard","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/nyregion/rise-in-hoax-calls-tests-coast-guard.html","abstract":"FOR three days last month, rescuers searched off Long Island for a boat on which a woman said her husband had fallen into a diabetic coma.

Inspired by the theology of liberation developed in Latin America, its adherents call for a complete transformation of Haitian society and an \"option in favor of the poor,\" the constituency on which Father Aristide drew.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940724","headline":". . .

By chance, someone happened to move their bomb-laden briefcase, and the Fuhrer was only wounded as walls shook in his underground command post in East Prussia. Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, the chief conspirator, had already left the room. On hearing the blast, he mistakenly assumed Hitler was dead and sped to Berlin to spur the revolt, only to be arrested and summarily executed later that day.    The July 20 plot was a noble failure, an honorable treason. Yet in a profound but poignant sense the failure triumphed. Nothing better became the conspirators than their demeanor when they were arrested, tortured, tried before a ranting Nazi judge and then strangled slowly with piano wire -- much of this filmed for Hitler's gratification. Of the nearly 200 principals who were thus executed, none recanted; several thousand other suspects were later convicted in civilian courts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940725","headline":"Elton John and Billy Joel: So Alike, So Different","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/25/arts/pop-review-elton-john-and-billy-joel-so-alike-so-different.html","abstract":"  When Elton John and Billy Joel performed together on Friday night at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., in the first of five sold-out shows ending this Friday, the concert began more like a diplomatic meeting than a pop music performance.
