When a writer opens an imagined cupboard in the corner of an imagined room, when she drops evidence into the pocket of some character's blue jeans, when she fills a town, a forest, a face with details, she searches for details with life, with personality, with influence.\n\nConcrete objects influence the best of stories. They have \n\nimpact \n\n-- a word that has to do with motion, with kinetic activity. When one object strikes another, it puts the second object in motion. And when the second object strikes a third, it does the same thing -- knocking the third object over, skewing it, throwing it off course. When an author writes a piece of fiction, she imagines that its details are billiard balls or dominoes, and then endows even the most apparently mundane of them with the properties of an eight ball or the energy of that first flick of a finger.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"A Homer in Japan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/sports/sports-people-baseball-a-homer-in-japan.html","abstract":"  JESSE BARFIELD made his debut in Japan with a two-run homer yesterday to help the Yomiuri Giants to a 5-2 victory over the Yokohama Bay Stars at the Tokyo Dome on the opening day of the Japanese season.

They have, one and all, a grand hieratic presence, and one that is disconcerting beyond all expectation.   The doll is, of course, one of the most potent of all household objects. In childhood, the idea of the doll that comes to life can be scary. As for the doll that falls apart or is thrown away, it may well have given us our first intimation of the role of loss in human affairs. In every house in which daughters have been raised, the doll has been there, as sample and surrogate and trial run.

Her name was omitted from this article, as it has been for years by textbooks, nonfictional publications, Watson and Crick's scientific manuscripts and, ironically enough, \"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA\" by James Watson.   Rosalind Franklin was a dedicated scientist working at the King's College laboratory in London in the 1950's, along with Maurice Wilkins, recipient of the 1962 Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology. While there she experimented with X-ray crystallography techniques on deoxyribonucleic acid and used these patterns to decipher the structure of DNA. As James Watson and Francis Crick were struggling with the idea of a triple helical structure, Rosalind Franklin found that DNA was a double helix with the sugar-phosphate backbone on the outside, contradicting Watson and Crick's ideas. In February 1953, Watson came to Franklin's laboratory and asked Maurice Wilkins if he could see the X-ray film patterns. Without asking her permission, Wilkins agreed to show him, and it was this secret information that aided Watson and Crick in their discovery of DNA's structure. To the day of her death, Rosalind never knew that her patterns were revealed to Watson and that this was the reason they won the \"competition\" for DNA's discovery. This information appears in \"Rosalind Franklin and DNA\" by Anne Sayre, published in 1975.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"New Life for Retirees In After-School Program","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/nyregion/new-life-for-retirees-in-afterschool-program.html","abstract":"A FOUNDER and co-director of a new volunteer organization will receive the Education Award of the Volunteer Center of United Way in White Plains as part of its yearly tribute to Westchester volunteers. \n\nBut the winner, Elise Nichols, insists that every other volunteer in RECS, which stands for Retired Educators Consulting Service, deserves it as much as she. \"We all did the same thing, developing a program day by day as we saw the needs of the children,\" she said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"Gathering Under The Big Top","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/style/evening-hours-gathering-under-the-big-top.html","abstract":"  A benefit for Childhelp USA, with the Cirque du Soleil, Battery Park City, April 7.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"The View From: Hartford;\nWill a College Put Some Zing Into Downtown After Dark?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/nyregion/the-view-from-hartford-will-a-college-put-some-zing-into-downtown-a.html","abstract":"INSTEAD of rushing back to her suburban Rocky Hill home after work, Fran Wynn, a paralegal in the State Attorney General's office, is spending a little more time in downtown Hartford taking a college computer course.\n\nSo are Patty and David Symonds of Glastonbury, owners of a Pearl Street photocopying business, and Bella Klebanov of West Hartford, a Russian immigrant and former accountant who works at a dry cleaning business near Constitution Plaza.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"If You're Thinking of Living in: Melville","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/realestate/if-youre-thinking-of-living-in-melville.html","abstract":"MIDWAY between the north and south shores of Suffolk County, just past the Nassau border, is Melville, a community of rolling hills, wooded sites -- and a thriving commercial-industrial corridor that takes up about a fifth of its land. \n\nThe corridor's spine is Route 110, a north-south artery lined with large office complexes, two hotels and stores and from which there is access to two major east-west highways.

The show is aptly named: until he was done in by the plague in 1576, at about the age of 90, Titian had a dominating place in the artistic landscape of the 16th century not unlike the one Matisse has occupied in ours. Titian's masterly effects of light, the richly textured surfaces of his late works, his noble and psychologically penetrating portrait style, and his ability to evoke, in the same painting, both intimacy and grandeur, set the pace for countless artists for the next several hundred years. All across Europe and well into the 1800's, from Rubens and Velazquez through Delacroix and Turner, painters felt compelled to respond to the art of Titian and to the accomplishments of other masters of the 16th century that are on view here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"ART;\nAncient Chinese Tomb Sculptures as Appeasers of the Spirit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/nyregion/art-ancient-chinese-tomb-sculptures-as-appeasers-of-the-spirit.html","abstract":"MORE than 40 years ago, Lillian Schloss and her late husband, Ezekiel, of New York City began collecting ancient Chinese tomb sculpture.

The character, played by James Earl Jones, claims to have known and played against Babe Ruth. It is a small scene, but one made more incongruous by the sight of a photograph of Mertle (the 19-year-old Mr. Jones) standing between Ruth and Lou Gehrig.    The idea of Ruth competing against a black player in the 1920's or 1930's may seem unlikely, because Jackie Robinson did not break baseball's color line until 1947. What the film does not explain is that major leaguers used to barnstorm in the off-season with players from the Negro Leagues.

In Virginia and New Jersey, the National Rifle Association recently suffered two defeats in quick succession against state legislatures; this surprised many on both sides of the gun control issue, because the N.R.A. has long been considered politically invincible, an impermeably strong lobby. \n\nIn Virginia, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder pushed the State Legislature to pass a law limiting the purchase of handguns to one a month; in New Jersey, the Legislature, under pressure from Gov. Jim Florio and a groundswell of public opinion, voted unanimously not to overturn the state's ban on assault weapons. Now the issue of gun control is heating up in Connecticut. Legislation banning both assault weapons and the inexpensive handguns known as Saturday night specials has emerged intact from the General Assembly's Public Safety Committee and will be taken up by the Judiciary Committee at a public hearing tomorrow. Assault weapons have become especially vulnerable to tighter controls because they are popular with gangs and drug dealers and are widely believed to have no legitimate civilian purpose, legislators say.\nA Coalition Gears Up\n\n A new gun control group, based in Fairfield County but hoping to become statewide, is also gearing up for the state's battle over gun control. The Connecticut Coalition Against Gun Violence says its short-term goal is really quite simple: \"This bill, this year,\" said Carol Leighton of Fairfield, the coalition's co-chairwoman. \"We want a statewide ban on assault weapons and Saturday night specials passed this year by both houses of the legislature, and signed by the Governor.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"Where Are the Italian-Americans?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/books/l-where-are-the-italian-americans-137093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   What a shame that in his welcome essay on the scarcity of Italian-American fiction writers, Gay Talese does not consider the missing literary voice of  Italian-American women.

Its name is French for beautiful marsh, and for all the world it would seem to belong on the Normandy coast. From a distance you can see the graceful curve of its small harbor repeated in an arc of stone town houses just beyond the sea wall, with a cluster of neat sailboats moored offshore. A tantalizing, rounded turret rears up in the background.\n\nThis is the look I remember of seaside towns in Normandy, and it was the Normans who gave Beaumaris its name, though they had to come a long way from home to do it. Beaumaris, or Biwmares, as it is spelled in Welsh, lies on the eastern shore of the Isle of Anglesey, which is 20 miles wide by 22 miles long, just off the coast of North Wales. To reach it you must cross the Menai Strait, a narrow channel of sweeping tides and treacherous sands, squeezed dramatically between dissimilar shores: on the mainland the immense mountains of Snowdonia fold in and out of the sky; to the west Anglesey lies low, like a great, green pool of earth slipped from the foothills. Leaning into the wind on the sea wall in Beaumaris you can look back across the strait and feel safe, ringed away from the world by mountains more fortresslike than the elegant 13th-century castle just down the street, also called Beaumaris. Yet here in the heart of Welsh-speaking Wales, this town with a French name and its Anglo-Norman castle are reminders that the world long ago found paths over and around the mountains to Anglesey. The Normans and the English came as conquerors, as did the Romans, though since the Middle Ages travelers have been traipsing across the island in more peaceable pursuit of the ferry to Dublin.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"Every Breeze Seems to Whisper Langer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/sports/golf-every-breeze-seems-to-whisper-langer.html","abstract":"  On a windswept afternoon when the holes at the Augusta National seemed to grow smaller, Bernhard Langer pulled off a destiny-evoking shot among a host of pyrotechnics today to take a commanding lead into the final round of the 57th Masters.

Located in Liberia, a country invented and settled long ago by offspring of American slaves, it became a ghost town in mid-March when its inhabitants fled a devastating air raid by Nigerian warplanes. All that was left of the town's hospital were bloodied sheets and mattresses in the emergency ward where the staff tried to save dozens of wounded civilians.

It might occur during the second encore at a Springsteen concert or nearing 4 A.M. on a downtown dance floor; at these moments, transcendence comes with an air of spontaneity, no matter how carefully orchestrated the circumstances. To actively seek some sort of nirvana (remember when it used to be a state of consciousness, not a band?) seems silly to the ranks of skeptics and hedonists that make up pop's hippest ranks. Enlightenment is iffy business, at least it was until raves brought young scene makers into a brand-new age.   Tipping its stocking cap to psychedelia, the English-borne dance movement known as rave encourages a belief in the possibilities of mind expansion through electronic beats and synthesized hallucinogens. On the dance floor, the quest resembles the dervish's twirl into frenzy. But even the most energetic ravers sometimes need a break and seek a space where their mental journeys can follow a less physically demanding path. This need has resulted in the establishment of chill-out rooms in clubs as well as the closest thing in years to a fashionable form of meditative music -- ambient house.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"WESTCHESTER GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/nyregion/westchester-guide-912493.html","abstract":"  SERIES ON RELIGIONS   Religion in the context of American democracy is the focus of four lectures to be given at Manhattanville College on Wednesday evenings under the umbrella title of \"Religion in the New World Order.\" Peter Gardella, associate professor of religion, will give the first talk this week on \"Evangelists of Democracy.\"   \"Islam and World Peace\" will be discussed on April 21 by James Edward Jones, who is also an associate professor of religion at the college.

The focus was on four modern-dance troupes, the Ballet du Rhin from Alsace (in an 18th-century reconstruction of the quintessential French ballet \"La Fille Mal Gardee\") and the Paris Opera Ballet. The latter turned out in full might with Rudolf Nureyev's staging of \"La Bayadere\" plus a mixed bill intended to show off a specifically French repertory.   Such programming suggests that French dance is split down the middle between establishment troupes and dissenters. It might be relevant, then, to recall the analysis that Francois Goguel, a French political scientist, applied to French society as a whole. France, he wrote in the 1940's, was perennially divided by the forces of movement and order.

(Cornell University, $14.95.) Nervous disorders seem to be a peculiarly American malaise. Tom Lutz shows how a constellation of symptoms ranging from insomnia to hot flashes became classified as \"neurasthenia,\" an illness that had a broad impact on our 20th-century culture. In 1991 our reviewer, Michael Vincent Miller, praised the writing as \"witty, concrete, gossipy and intellectually pluralistic.\"   FORTUNATE LIVES, by Robb Forman Dew. (Harper Perennial, $10.) Martin and Dinah Howells seem fortunate in every way: they live comfortably in a New England college town with their daughter, Sarah, and son David, who is about to leave for his freshman year at Harvard. But his leave-taking stirs up memories of the couple's other boy, Toby, who died in an accident, and the summer becomes a time when the family's bonds are tested. \" 'Bittersweet' is one of the best words for parenthood . . . and it is perhaps the right word for this novel,\" Ron Carlson said here last year. Harper Perennial has also reissued Ms. Dew's first novel, DALE LOVES SOPHIE TO DEATH ($10), which introduced the Howells family. In 1981 our reviewer, Katha Pollitt, said the rewards of the novel, which won an American Book Award, are \"quiet but rich, and prove once again that in fiction there are no automatically compelling subjects.

Compared to the guitar, the piano has always been a kind of stepchild of rock.  Although it has enjoyed a secure place in rock's instrumental arsenal since the days of Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis, it has never entirely shed its highbrow aura. And for reasons that have a lot to do with the music's macho rebel side, rock has yet to spawn a keyboard hero with the Dionysian mystique of Jimi Hendrix or the godlike one of Eric Clapton. An unfortunate stereotype of the male pianist that persists is of a mama's boy who is too busy practicing his scales to go outdoors and play baseball.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"Putting the Poor in Uniform","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/books/putting-the-poor-in-uniform.html","abstract":"  WORKING-CLASS WAR   American Combat Soldiers and Vietnam.

Vaccines contain a microorganism or virus in a weakened, live or killed state, or proteins or toxins from the organism. In stimulating the body's adaptive immunity, they help prevent sickness from an infectious disease. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, herd immunity results. Herd immunity protects those who may be immunocompromised and cannot get a vaccine because even a weakened version would harm them. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the elimination of diseases such as polio and tetanus from much of the world. However, some diseases, such as measles outbreaks in America, have seen rising cases due to relatively low vaccination rates in the 2010s – attributed, in part, to vaccine hesitancy.

Mr. Adams's van pool seems at first glance to be a working model for the clean air remedy specified in the new law: cutting down on the number of people commuting alone in cars. But his experience is actually a sobering illustration of the obstacles that will face thousands of companies across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as other areas with severe air pollution, as they try to change a basic habit: the way people get to work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930412","headline":"IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/12/opinion/IHT-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago-92587494218.html","abstract":"1918: Emperor's Letter.PARIS - An official Note issued last night [April 11] gives the text of a letter from the Austrian Emperor, dated March 31, 1917, to President Poincaré: \"France has shown magnificent resistance and courage.

In \"Owners,\" her first play to be produced professionally, she attacked the right of ownership, as it applies to real estate and marital relations. When the work was staged in the 1970's, critics were put off by the anarchic storytelling.

The most imposing task is in casting: to find a tenor who, over more than five hours, is able to sustain good tone, often in a high tessitura, and create nuanced interpretations against an orchestra often blaring fortissimo. This tenor must also seem hopelessly callow and blustery one hour (\"a regular Li'l Abner type,\" Anna Russell once said) and incurably passionate the next. And at the end of his quest he must find a soprano of surpassing power to justify the first love duet in Wagner's cosmic history, leaving far behind the opera's fairy-tale dragon, shattered sword and riddle-posing god.   There was a fair amount of heroism in this performance (as listeners to the radio broadcast would have heard), but there was also a fair amount of effort. Siegfried, found after much scrambling around in the minuscule heldentenor circuit, was William Johns. He has enough of the equipment and physical stamina to provide an often respectable rendering, itself no mean feat.

Its persistent underestimation is puzzling; this is possibly Donizetti's finest tragic opera, at the very least a more dramatically sound and musically fluid work than \"Lucia di Lammermoor.\"    First staged in 1830, \"Anna Bolena\" was Donizetti's first major success, the opera that marked his emergence as a rival of Bellini. The composer had the good fortune to receive a superb libretto from Felice Romani; the historical record of Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour and Henry VIII was set aside in favor of psychologically precise character studies. Anne turns away the advances of Lord Percy and the musician Smeton, but the king's infatuation with Jane guarantees that disaster will fall all the same. The key to the piece is the king, whose patriarchal malevolence dooms the lyric strains of romance around him.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930412","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/12/nyregion/chronicle-203293.html","abstract":"  When the Soviet Union split apart and the Communist Party collapsed, cultural institutions were left floundering without the financial and legal help of a monolithic dictatorship.

Unlike Lincoln Center's Mozart Bicentennial, which crammed Mozart's works into 18 months, the plan here was to offer Schubert's works chronologically, taking from 1988 to 1997 to present them. That proved commercially unworkable, at least in the short term: the early seasons drew connoisseurs and revealed a few gems, but as with Mozart and Beethoven, the works likely to draw big audiences come near the end. The chronological approach was scuttled just as the series was heading toward the popular works, but at least the project has continued.   The new format has its own logic. Instead of tracing the big picture, the Schubertiade now offers glimpses into specific aspects of the composer's work, with early and late works performed side by side. This year the focus was on Schubert's piano sonatas, and instead of distributing the works among several players, Andras Schiff played them all (except for a few fragmentary ones) in a six-concert series that ended on April 3 evening.

The work is the first to identify a specific gene associated with attention deficit difficulties, and it suggests that a fraction of children with the problem may in fact have an undiagnosed thyroid disorder.   Child psychiatrists and other experts on the behavioral problem, however, emphasized that the finding was preliminary and that it was likely to be of relevance to only a small number of the millions of children who have the attention-deficit disorder. Many researchers insisted that much work remained to be done before they would recommend that all children with an attention deficit diagnosis have their thyroid hormone levels checked. Possible Clue to Other Ills    Nevertheless, they said that any possible insight into the cause and physiology of the ailment was welcome and that an understanding of how thyroid metabolism shapes brain development may yield clues to other neurological defects underlying other types of attention-deficit problems.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Health"},{"date":"19930413","headline":"U.S. Abortion Protesters Shunned by the British","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/13/world/us-abortion-protesters-shunned-by-the-british.html","abstract":"  When they arrived here more than two weeks ago, the small cadre of American militants opposed to abortion sought to establish a European beachhead, an outpost for pressing their emotional campaign to nations like Britain, where abortion rarely provokes the raw, confrontational debate it does in the United States.
