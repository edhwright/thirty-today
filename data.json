With the first phrase of the score, sensitively performed here by Jerry Zimmerman, it was tempting to heed George Balanchine's observation that dancegoers may simply close their eyes and listen to the music at City Ballet. But the spare simplicity of the dance's opening statement of theme, performed with a good mix of lyricism and grandeur by Simone Schumacher and Alexandre Proia, lures one into the ballet's outpouring of group and small-ensemble dances and of carefully joined styles that range from Baroque dance to gentle acrobatics.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930120","headline":"Cuomo Proposes Spartan Budget With Cutbacks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/20/nyregion/cuomo-proposes-spartan-budget-with-cutbacks.html","abstract":"  Gov.

The same slate of candidates that he and his fellow commissioners narrowly defeated in 1991, inspired by the closeness of that vote, brought the recall drive.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930120","headline":"Malcolm X's Lesson","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/20/opinion/l-malcolm-x-s-lesson-405193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your Jan. 6 editorial \"When X = Literacy,\" on how Malcolm X transformed himself by learning to read and write in prison, is most significant in view of the increasing numbers of people taken into custody who are functionally illiterate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930120","headline":"Husband Shoots 2 and Himself In Dallas Court","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/20/us/husband-shoots-2-and-himself-in-dallas-court.html","abstract":"  An enraged husband shot his wife and then turned the gun on himself today in the hallway of a Dallas courthouse just as they were entering a hearing on a family dispute.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday evening, but surely one of the most inviting was the free concert at Riverside Church, in which Kurt Masur conducted a student orchestra from the Mannes College of Music in a Duke Ellington suite that commemorated Dr. King in its finale. The large interdenominational church was, in fact, an ideal place to remember Dr. King and his message: on April 4, 1967, exactly a year before he was killed, Dr. King gave an antiwar speech there, and it was tempting to imagine him standing at the pulpit.    The concert was an interesting but, from a musical standpoint, only partly successful experiment. It seemed to be the kind of thing Mr. Masur has had in mind since he became the music director of the New York Philharmonic, when he spoke of building bridges between New York and Leipzig (where he directs the Gewandhaus Orchestra) and of taking part in New York's musical life beyond the confines of Avery Fisher Hall. He surrounded Ellington's polystylistic \"Trois Rois Noirs,\" a quintessentially American work, two works by Leipzig masters, Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D (BWV 1068) and Mendelssohn's \"Reformation\" Symphony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930120","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/20/style/chronicle-411693.html","abstract":"  Dr. WALTER H.

Prezioso, the man charged with bringing order to Westchester County's cumbersome system of overlapping local governments, will celebrate his 80th birthday on Valentine's Day. He will celebrate it, that is, assuming he can squeeze it into his schedule of 12-hour days and 6-day weeks. (He has not taken a vacation in seven years, he said, and he is proud of it.)   \"It's amazing,\" said Dr. Edward J. Mortola, the former chancellor and president of Pace University, who turns 76 next week and who brought Dr. Prezioso to Pace in the 1970's. \"I see no change in his constitution or his ability to work over the past 20 years. No one thinks in terms of age when they think of Sal.\" Westchester 2000    Instead, what many think of is an accomplished problem-solver who has served five Westchester County executives, three New York governors, one mayor of Yonkers and the Rockefeller family, although he has never held elected office. He also found time to earn a doctorate in education from Columbia University and to teach public administration at Pace for 13 years, ending in 1990.   It was his resume, as well as his reputation as a mender of badly damaged political fences, that earned Dr. Prezioso the unenviable job that he has held since 1986: executive director of Westchester 2000, a nonpartisan partnership of government and business that is taking a sweeping look at how the county and its municipalities govern themselves. The project has solicited the ideas of hundreds of people, most notably taxpayers and academics.   Among the questions Dr. Prezioso must address are why, for example, does the town of Greenburgh, population 83,000, need seven police departments -- one for each of its six incorporated villages and one for the town? Why is there a town of Ossining and a village of Ossining? Why must the village of Mamaroneck be in the town of Mamaroneck and the town of Rye, which is separate from the city of Rye?   After seven years of overseeing the collection and analysis of data from the smallest school board to the upper echelons of county government, Dr. Prezioso will issue the group's recommendations in late September.   He will then try to persuade local governments to take the bitter medicine that he is expected to prescribe for the county's 6 cities, 17 towns and 22 villages. That is most likely to include the recommendation -- unthinkable to many residents -- that some villages and towns should cast aside long-held differences and merge.   \"No one wants to give up the throne,\" Dr. Prezioso said. \"But we cannot afford to have that many kings.\" Fierce Identification    The problem, Dr. Prezioso said, is that with revenues shrinking and expenditures rising, it has become an unjustifiable luxury to maintain the quilt of sometimes redundant jurisdictions that is the hallmark of Westchester governance.   Simplifying such interlocking relationships will be no mean feat, in part because Westchester residents, like others throughout the New York metropolitan region and the nation, fiercely identify with the communities where they live.   In Elmsford, an incorporated village of 3,900 that is within the town of Greenburgh, there was talk in the mid-1980's of absorbing the village government into that of the much larger town. The residents of Elmsford shot the proposal down, said Arthur DeAngelis, the village mayor.   \"They wanted their own control,\" Mayor DeAngelis said of Elmsford residents. \"In our village, the police know everyone. When they see kids on the corner and something happens, they know what kids were in the area that could have done it. We'll go to the parents and they take disciplinary action. A small village, you can do that.\"   If consolidation is necessary, Mayor DeAngelis said, then why not eliminate Greenburgh's government, which he believes has been rendered unnecessary by the six \"self-sufficient\" village governments within the town.   Not surprisingly, the Greenburgh town supervisor, Paul Feiner, disagrees. He says Greenburgh's government is needed to oversee an unincorporated section of town, as well as to administer townwide services like tax collection and painting street lines. It would, he said, be too costly for the villages to handle the town functions on their own.   \"I don't think Westchester really needs a county government,\" Mr. Feiner counters.   And so it goes.   While agreeing with Dr. Prezioso that Westchester government has become too costly and layered, Dr. Anthony Cupaiuolo, a professor of public administration at Pace, cautioned against too much consolidation. He said many villages sprang up within towns because many residents felt that they were losing control of their own destinies.    \"It's grass-roots democracy in action,\" said Dr. Cupaiuolo, director of the Michaelian Institute for Sub/Urban Governance at Pace in White Plains. \"A village of 3,000 people -- they elect a mayor! They elect a board of trustees! People can actually show up at the village hall and yell and scream about how government is operating.   \"It's a question of efficiency versus responsiveness,\" he added.   Dr. Cupaiuolo said he would very likely support some of Dr. Prezioso's proposals like consolidating services between municipalities, which has been done elsewhere in the region. Consolidation, he said, would save money without disrupting a community's sense of identity.  Resistance Expected    \"It's very sensitive and delicate material,\" said Sy J. Schulman, former president of the Westchester County Association, a collection of corporations that is a sponsor of Westchester 2000. \"People are ambivalent. On the one hand, they complain about taxes. On the other hand, they are proud of local government. They don't realize that pride has a price.\"   Dr. Prezioso, whose recommendations would be subject to the approval of the individual governments, said he would demonstrate that the plans, custom-tailored for each municipality, have been exhaustively studied and were workable.   \"I expect a battle,\" he said. \"I know quite well there's going to be resistance to change.\"   Asked why he would want a job with such aggravation, Dr. Prezioso said that retirement, to say nothing of a vacation, \"is for sick people.\"   \"There is,\" he said, \"a sincerity of purpose on my part to seek the attention of people, to show them what they're up against so that they can control the future.\"   Told that that sounded a bit stiff, he said, with humor: \"My chemistry is enhanced! My whole body vibrates with excitement in terms of moving people into certain directions!\"   Dr. Cupaiuolo, who was hired at Pace by Dr. Prezioso, says that his former supervisor's enthusiasm is genuine.   \"He has no need to do this in terms of some ulterior motive,\" Dr. Cupaiuolo said. \"Ultimately, he wants to see citizens well-served.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930121","headline":"Report on Melee in Belmar Criticizes Resort and MTV","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/21/nyregion/report-on-melee-in-belmar-criticizes-resort-and-mtv.html","abstract":"  A commission investigating the civil disturbance that erupted last summer in Belmar after a two-day concert and sports event today criticized the seaside resort and the event's sponsor, MTV, for not providing enough security at the event.

None other than Barry Manilow, unhipness incarnate, was the first big star trotted out for a program that featured ballads, ballads, ballads. It made the average Grammy Awards telecast sound avant-garde.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930121","headline":"Barkley's Harangue Costs $10,000 and One Game","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/21/sports/basketball-barkley-s-harangue-costs-10000-and-one-game.html","abstract":"  All the guy did was berate an official after a close game, scrambling over the scorers' table and haranguing the man all the way into the dressing room area, and all of a sudden the National Basketball Association wants to make a big deal of it.

After working as a duo for more than 45 years, the singer Jackie Cain and the singer and pianist Roy Kral took the last year off to live a very different kind of life. The husband-and-wife team drove around the country without having to be on a schedule, and for the first time they could fully enjoy the house in Montclair, N.J., that they have owned for many years. But now they are back following their old way of life. Tonight through Sunday, they are winding up a week at Tavern on the Green with a show that includes some of their favorite songs by composers like Stephen Sondheim and Alec Wilder, and some new additions to their repertory by Dave Brubeck (\"In Your Own Sweet Way\" and \"The Duke\"). They are also dipping into Duke Ellington for the first time as they begin to explore his work in depth. They perform tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, 10:30 and 12:30 and on Sunday night at 8:30 and 10:30. No minimum; $15 music charge tonight and tomorrow, $10 on Sunday.  Heavenly Dixieland    Kenny Davern Quartet, Church of the Heavenly Rest, Fifth Avenue at 90th Street, (212) 752-1428 or 556-3865. From the often-stereotyped world of Dixieland jazz, the clarinetist Kenny Davern has shaped a style filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep alive the dry and wry manner of Pee Wee Russell and provide a setting for his own refreshing explorations. His quartet, with Howard Alden on guitar, Frank Tate on bass and Tony De Nicola on drums, returns to the Heavenly Jazz series on Sunday afternoon, exactly one year after its last appearance there. Tickets for the concert, which starts at 5 P.M., will be on sale at the door for $10 ($7 for students and the elderly).  Guitar With Polish    Frank Vignola Trio, J's, 2581 Broadway, between 97th and 98th Streets, Manhattan, (212) 666-3600. Frank Vignola, a guitarist who initially traded on the fame of Django Reinhardt's precise and swinging single-string solos, is now working in a much broader area that encompasses material from swing to bop to Latin jazz.

Kennedy, from his birth in 1917 to his assassination in 1963. I was graciously welcomed by Jacqueline Onassis (my father had been a friend of J.F.K. and of Robert F. Kennedy). Senator Edward Kennedy promised a series of interviews about his own family background, his grandfather John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, his parents and, above all, his elder brother.\n\nUnfortunately, Senator Kennedy canceled the interviews in 1989. Nevertheless, when we met at Harvard the following year, he effusively praised my efforts, saying that he hadheard from Arthur Schlesinger what \"fine\" preliminary lectures on J.F.K.'s early years I'd given at my university. Once again, the Senator promised help and cooperation and, to demonstrate his sincerity, called me over to meet his sister Eunice, who to my great delight promised to make available to me her unique letters from J.F.K., particularly those sent from Lithuania at the start of World War II, my special area of interest.\n\nSadly, the promises again proved empty. Instead, six months later, I was called by Milton Gwirtzman, a Washington-based lawyer acting on behalf of the Kennedys, who asked me to \"alter my attitude\" toward Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Kennedy, as reflected in the very lectures Arthur Schlesinger had extolled and which had meanwhile been published in the New England Journal of Public Policy. \n\nTaken aback by the lawyer's proposal, I countered that, despite my credentials as a scholarly biographer, I had not received one jot of help from the Kennedys -- after three years of promises. Yet here they were, demanding that I alter my \"attitude\" (the photocopy of the journal article that Mr. Gwirtzman handed to me was scored in the text and the margins with scarlet ink!). I asked him to take a humble but firm message back to Washington: I would be glad to revise the portrait of J.F.K.'s parents, sketched in the lectures, if new evidence warranted such revision.\n\nI pointed out that hundreds of early J.F.K. letters were missing, having been removed from the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston by members of the Kennedy family or withheld from public access on their behalf. If permitted to see these letters, I would, if the evidence prove conclusive, willingly amend my somewhat unsparing account of J.F.K.'s childhood -- in particular, the emotional neglect by his mother when he was small, the despotism of his manically ambitious father and the effect of such a dysfunctional marriage on J.F.K.'s character. \n\nIn due course, Mr. Gwirtzman was authorized to search the family's secret holdings in the library for evidence that would justify revision. Letters were indeed found, he informed me, but they did not contradict my interpretation. As a result, I was not even permitted to see, let alone quote, from them. Senator Kennedy declined to cooperate in any further way. Eunice Shriver, likewise.\n\nWorse was to follow. On one occasion, my private mail was opened and its contents discussed by the staff of the John F. Kennedy Library -- normally a Federal offense. Although the perpetrator was reprimanded by the director, the atmosphere at the library soured considerably. The chief archivist, who had been on sick leave, was asked to resign on the day of his return. He had been a tower of strength to me and other researchers at the library. He bravely refused, with the immortal words, \"You will have to shoot me first.\" But it was a very near thing.\n\nMeanwhile, in deference to the Kennedys I was disinvited from an international academic conference on \"J.F.K. and Europe,\" held in Florence in October 1992. Although, after protesting I was reinvited to give the opening paper, I was not, in the end, permitted to deliver it -- to spare, I was told, the \"family feelings\" of the human rights activist Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, who was attending as the \"Kennedy representative.\" (Ms. Cuomo marched out of the auditorium when, during a debate on J.F.K.'s views on European security, I did manage to speak, briefly.)\n\nWhether my 926-page historical biography -- which takes J.F.K.'s heroic early life up to the age of 29 -- merits the vituperative labels bestowed by the Kennedys in a Dec. 3 article on this page, I am still too partial to judge. Nevertheless, I emphatically reject the accusation that it is \"reckless biography.\" No author could have done more to solicit the help and involvement of the Kennedys at every stage of research. Their lack of cooperation not only led me to believe that they not only dislike history but are also determined to defy its demands to the final bell, as they have for 30 years.\n\nFor instance, although Mrs. Onassis formally deeded the President's personal and official papers to the John F. Kennedy Library and the people of the U.S., many documents either never reached the library, or have been withdrawn, or have been tampered with, or have been concealed from researchers -- even from the library's own staff. Many collections, such as the Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Papers, are still under lock and key. Thousands of documents belonging to \"open\" collections have been removed or sanitized over the years to avoid the wrath of the Kennedys. \n\nCountless crucial documents -- such as J.F.K.'s medical files -- lie moldering in the vaults amid debate over whether to risk family retribution and open them. And this in a Federal archive! Most significant, in the library's great collection of interviews with colleagues, friends and subordinates of President Kennedy (numbering more than 1,500), there is not one single available serious interview with a member of the family about J.F.K., the man and brother.\n\nThis contempt for history is distressing. Truth, after all, is therapeutic, and though some details of J.F.K.'s rather louche private life are embarrassing to older family members and their lackeys, they are not shocking to my students, who were not even alive in 1963 and cling to no Camelot sentiment. Rather, as they explore with me the enormous difficulties J.F.K. faced in his life -- not the least difficulty being his ill health -- they gain in sympathy and understanding of the man. \n\nIs it too late for the Kennedys to alter their own attitude, as they once demanded I should alter mine? I do not think so. As the dust settles on the first edition of \"J.F.K.: Reckless Youth,\" perhaps Senator Kennedy and his sisters will rethink their response. I remain eminently willing to revise my text if the documents warrant. Moreover, to balance the many J.F.K. letters to which I did obtain access, and the intimate testimony given to me by J.F.K.'s closest surviving friends on the matter of his parents, I remain perfectly willing to talk with Senator Kennedy and his sisters and to quote their views. In \nmy opinion, they still have a vital historical contribution to make, if only they will bestir themselves. \n\nMy plea to the Kennedys, then, is to stop fiddling while the memory of J.F.K. burns. A recent memo from the Jean Monnet Council of George Washington University (which sponsored the Florence conference on J.F.K. and Europe) puts the matter succinctly: \"Kennedy's reputation today may be at something of a nadir.\" I urge the elder Kennedys, under a new President devoted to J.F.K.'s idealistic example, to help insure J.F.K.'s truthful place in history for a new generation of Americans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930122","headline":"When MICA's Commit Murder","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/opinion/when-mica-s-commit-murder.html","abstract":"  The public's concern last summer focused on Larry Hogue, whose drug-related mental illness led to menace and violence on Manhattan's West Side.

Three years ago, an extensive retrospective of work by the German couple was held at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea; now a show at the Sonnabend Gallery in SoHo offers updated versions of some of their familiar grid works, as well as a selection of recent single-frame pictures.   In carrying out their distinctive brand of industrial archeology, the Bechers rely on a clearly defined method. They photograph their subjects in as neutral a way as possible, usually recording them head on with a large-format camera. The pictures are often taken on overcast days, reducing the possibility of expressive variations in lighting; the resulting images are presented in grids that in some cases include 20 or more black-and-white prints.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930122","headline":"Katie Beers's Mother Asks to Cede Financial Control","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/nyregion/katie-beers-s-mother-asks-to-cede-financial-control.html","abstract":"  The Suffolk County Attorney should take charge of Katie Beers's financial affairs, including any money she may receive from movie deals, Katie's mother, Marilyn Beers, said today.

Bonnie Frankel is a 48-year-old senior at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles. She was unable to compete on the varsity track team because she had originally enrolled in college in 1962. Under National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, the five-year period of eligibility at Division I schools begins the first day of enrollment. Bonnie had dropped out of school in 1963, but by 1967 she was out of luck anyway.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930122","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/nyregion/c-corrections-839293.html","abstract":"  A brief report in Business Day on Wednesday about the earnings of the Chemical Banking Corporation misstated the change in its net income for all of 1992, compared with 1991.

For most of its 39 years, the event has been something of an institution on the antiques circuit, but in recent seasons this decidedly American show had become overridden with boring brown furniture, banal objects and works of dubious provenance.   Then the arrival of the fall International Antiques Show at the armory four years ago changed things. And for the better. For starters, the quality controls at the Winter Antiques Show became stricter. They had to. Since the International Show is vetted, a practice common in Europe but still relatively new in the United States, the Winter Show felt it had to follow. Dealers at the Winter Show have always been required to offer customers a certificate of authenticity for every purchase, but this year, in addition to the guarantees, a committee made up of more than 70 dealers, scholars and art experts toured the armory, reviewing the objects in every booth. Anything they found questionable was removed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930122","headline":"Upturn Continues in Most Areas, Fed Reports","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/us/upturn-continues-in-most-areas-fed-reports.html","abstract":"  With the notable exception of California, the economy showed continued improvement in December and early January, with sizable gains in retail sales augmented by better activity in factories and residential construction, a survey published today by the Federal Reserve Board said.
