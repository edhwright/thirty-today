The time they spend alone, cruising in their cars, would seem ample space for introspection, if not for all of Tolstoy, via books on tape.

It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise in North America, and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) considers it to be one of the \"most important championships available to the sport\". The trophy was commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup and is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canada, who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. The entire Stanley family supported the sport, the sons and daughters all playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to the Montreal Hockey Club, and winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the two main professional ice hockey organizations, reached an agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. It was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19940614","time":"1994-06-14

At times it has been the opposition, meant to illuminate the concept of jazz as experimental and inclusive, which the JVC Jazz Festival hasn't subscribed to. And at others it has been produced under the auspices of the JVC Jazz Festival itself. This year, much to its benefit, the Knitting Factory anticipated the JVC Jazz Festival by a week, and has no connection with that event.   The current What Is Jazz?, which started on Sunday and will run through June 22, is the strongest in years. It presents its own point of view without being reactionary or apologetic. And showcasing performers who straddle the line between jazz-related improvisation and more traditional jazz, the festival makes it clear that a sizable community of musicians exists in that world along with a dedicated audience.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940615","headline":"Give Messier a Hand, To Wear His 6th Ring","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/15/sports/stanley-cup-finals-give-messier-a-hand-to-wear-his-6th-ring.html","abstract":"  Mark Messier already owned five Stanley Cup rings, one for each finger of his left hand, when he arrived in New York at the start of the 1991-92 season.

These tips for both city and suburban commuters were compiled from the Transit Authority, the New York City Transportation Department, and consumer transportation advocates. Leave early or late. The best times for getting a morning subway train are between 5 and 6 A.M., and between 9 and 10 A.M. The worst time is between 8 and 9 A.M. Going home, the best times are between 3 and 4 P.M., and between 7 and 8 P.M. The worst is from 5 to 6 P.M. Avoid the E and F subway lines from Jamaica to midtown Manhattan. These express lines, which generally provide the fastest and most convenient service to midtown, are already the most crowded in the city. Though they are the easiest to reach for many Long Island commuters, the Transit Authority is urging suburbanites to look elsewhere.   If you insist on heading to the first stations on the E, F or 7 lines, prepare to wait outside the stations until the police let you down the stairs. To keep masses of riders from holding open train doors, officers will be \"metering\" the crowds by restricting access to the platforms. Metering will also take place in the afternoons at the Fifth Avenue and Lexington Avenue stations on the E and F lines in Manhattan. Try the J and Z trains, which leave from Jamaica Center at Parsons Boulevard and Archer Avenue and head for lower Manhattan; they are generally under-used. Even if you're headed for midtown, it will be faster to take one of these trains and transfer to the uptown IRT at Chambers Street/Brooklyn Bridge. Second-best are the 7 line from Flushing to midtown and the A and C trains from southern Queens to downtown. These lines are already crowded, but not as much as the E and F trains. Charter buses ($5 from Nassau, $8 from Suffolk) will drop off Long Island commuters to the parking lots at Shea Stadium on the 7 and Kennedy International Airport on the A. Avoid transferring bewteen the 7 train and the E and F lines at 74th Street and Broadway in Queens, because there will be limited room on the trains and the police will be metering the crowds. The 7 train will be entirely local for the duration of the strike, which will mean more trains for riders at local stations but will annoy those used to an express ride.    And if the strike continues until the next day game at Shea Stadium on June 29, stay away from the stadium lot. Take local trains rather than expresses. The R train from Forest Hills to midtown will be more comfortable than the E and F trains on the same track. Subway riders in the Kew Gardens area are advised to walk or take a bus a few blocks west on Queens Boulevard to an R stop. Dress for the Tropics. Nearly all of the special buses to the Queens subway stops will be school buses without air conditioning. And there are likely to be far more people than tickets, so have a backup in mind. If you're driving in from Long Island, consider taking Jericho Turnpike, Route 25a and Sunrise Highway as alternatives to the Long Island Expressway, the Northern State Parkway and the Southern State Parkway. But be advised that less congested roads are likely to fill quickly. \"Traffic is like water, it follows the path of least resistance,\" said Melvin I. Cooperman, a State Transportation Department spokesman. Parking. Transportation officials say that if you must drive, try to leave the car in Queens of Brooklyn rather than driving into Manhattan. Long Island drivers who know Queens well can try parking on city streets near local stops on less-popular trains. Stephen Dobrow, president of the Committee for Better Transit, a consumer group, recommends driving to Astoria and taking the N train, or parking in Elmhurst or Woodside along the R line. To make these schemes easier, the city has suspended alternate-side parking in Queens and Brooklyn until the strike is over.   There are also inexpensive parking lots near Queens Center, downtown Jamaica and Queensborough Plaza that are adjacent to subway stops. But getting that far into Queens on jam-packed roads will be hard enough. And Robert Slovak, a T.A. spokesman, advises commuters not to cruise the streets of Queens aimlessly looking for a space. \"Take a map,\" he suggests. Don't think about Monday, Thursday and Friday will probably be bad but next week will probably be worse. Those who can skip work today and tomorrow will probably rejoin the commute by then.
