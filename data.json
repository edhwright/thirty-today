Just moments after the previous government resigned, he joined with parties from the far right and far left to railroad 13 measures through an all-night session of Parliament that sent Slovakia reeling back to the bad old days.   Mr. Meciar was never able to command more than 83 votes in the 150-member Parliament during the session. But with the opposition caught off guard and with only a simple majority required for legislation, he was able to do enormous damage to Slovakia's painful efforts to move toward a private economy and enlarge individual freedoms. In effect, he turned back the clock.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"In Line to lead: Senior Republican Senators","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/the-1994-elections-parties-in-line-to-lead-senior-republican-senators.html","abstract":"  Senators likely to lead Senate committees, based on their seniority.

Pataki set about transforming his campaign into a government yesterday, pledging to move quickly to enact the death penalty and a deep tax cut.    The extent of the challenge quickly became evident when Cuomo administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the state could face a budget shortfall next year of $4 billion or more. A gap of that size -- the state's general fund budget is $34 billion this year -- could make it exceedingly difficult for Mr. Pataki to deliver the first stage of his promise to cut income tax rates by 25 percent over four years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"THE 1994 ELECTIONS: PARTIES - THE OUTLOOK: As One Party Prepares to Run the Capitol, the Other Hunts for Leaders; Republicans Get Chance on Taxes, Crime and Welfare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/1994-elections-parties-outlook-one-party-prepares-run-capitol-other-hunts-for.html","abstract":"  The Republicans have left no doubt where they stand.

Mr. Silver, the quiet veteran state legislator from Manhattan's Lower East Side, will be in a position to shape and perhaps even block much of Governor-elect George E. Pataki's agenda.   Mr. Pataki's core campaign pledge, a 25 percent reduction in the state's personal income tax rate, must go for approval to the Democratic-controlled Assembly, which Mr. Silver leads, and to the Republican-dominated Senate. The coming battles over whether to approve the tax cuts, when to impose them, how to trim state spending and how to protect local communities from a loss of vital state aid, will all inevitably find themselves right on Mr. Silver's desk.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"F.A.A.

Bernstein's songs from this 1953 musical are as spirited as they ever were; the question is whether the show was always as campy and cliched as it was on Tuesday.    It's likely that even when it first opened to enthusiastic reviews, the show had a hint of camp, a hip humor based on a sense of superiority to the story's stock figurines. Bernstein and the lyricists had stepped in at the last minute to rescue a failing enterprise, and in cobbling this show together in four weeks they relied on character types for effect, leaning a bit on their earlier collaborative success, \"On the Town.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"Midwest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/the-1994-elections-state-by-state-midwest.html","abstract":"  ILLINOIS   Once one of the most powerful lawmakers in Congress, Representative Dan Rostenkowski was soundly defeated by a relative unknown, Michael P. Flanagan. Mr. Rostenkowski, an 18-term Chicago Democrat, was forced to relinquish the chairmanship of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee earlier this year after his indictment on corruption charges. Nonetheless, his defeat on Tuesday was considered a huge upset in the ward politics of Chicago, which in earlier times did not find indictments particularly troublesome.   As expected, Gov. Jim Edgar won a second term, trouncing his Democratic challenger, Dawn Clark Netsch.    In other Congressional races, one other Republican managed to win a seat that had been in Democratic hands. The district in Joliet that has been held by Representative George E. Sangmeister, a Democrat who is retiring, was won by State Representative Gerald C.

Pataki    Mr. Pataki, who will be New York's 53d governor, is the first Republican to be elected Governor since 1970 and the first without New York City roots since Nathan Miller of Syracuse 50 years before that. Like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Pataki, a 49-year-old State Senator who was an Assemblyman and a Mayor of Peekskill, inherits a politically divided Legislature that could be a check on his agenda. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR  Elizabeth McCaughey    If Mr. Pataki was the seasoned pol, Ms. McCaughey, who is 46 and lives in Manhattan, was the ticket's policy wonk. She was recruited from the confines of the Manhattan Institute. The Pataki campaign was short on substance, but state government revels in details. Will Ms. McCaughey be the brains behind the Pataki administration, or be left behind altogether when the guys get down to business? COMPTROLLER  H. Carl McCall    Elected by the Legislature last year to fill Edward V. Regan's unexpired term, the 58-year-old Mr. McCall survived the Republican sweep as the lone Democrat -- and the first black -- elected to statewide office in Albany. Typically, the comptroller is a naysayer, warning the Governor and Legislature not to spend what they don't have and berating them for past inefficiencies. New accounting constraints and his political independence may amplify his voice. ATTORNEY GENERAL  Dennis C. Vacco    As a former Federal prosecutor from Buffalo, he has promised to transform the office of Attorney General into a platform for changing the criminal justice system, and restoration of the death penalty has dominated his platform. But the job is considerably broader than that, and Mr. Vacco, who is 42, is largely untested as a consumer advocate and an architect of legislation within an attorney general's domain. ASSEMBLY SPEAKER  Sheldon Silver    As the Assembly Speaker, this 18-year veteran of the Legislature becomes perhaps the most powerful Democrat in the state. He is unabashedly liberal, resisting even some of Mr. Cuomo's more moderate initiatives. Moreover, as a New York City resident, representing the Lower East Side, he is likely to emerge as the city's chief defender in a state government that, presumably, will be less receptive to City Hall's legislative agenda. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER  Ralph J. Marino    The Senate majority leader, who was the chief Republican check and balance on the Cuomo administration, retains his seat, representing part of Nassau and Suffolk, and the Republicans kept their majority. But he may lose his leadership. Mr. Marino and his fellow Republican, Mr. D'Amato, are political rivals and he only grudgingly endorsed Mr. Pataki. Ambiguously, Mr. Pataki said only that he would not interfere when the Senate picks its leaders. SAM ROBERTS                    --------------------       Some Who Are Close to Governor-Elect    A representative, but incomplete, guide to those who have the ear of Gov.-elect George E. Pataki. MICHAEL FINNEGAN Former law partner, State Senate aide, campaign counsel, and old political friend. Is to Mr. Pataki what Peter J. Powers is to Rudolph W. Giuliani. UNITED STATES SENATOR ALFONSE M. D'AMATO Helped anoint Mr. Pataki with the party hierarchy, raised money and devised strategy for the campaign. In exchange, Mr. Pataki announced yesterday: \"You can call me, Al.\" CLARENCE D. RAPPLEYEA JR.  Known as \"Rapp,\" he was Mr. Pataki's mentor in the Assembly, where he is minority leader. A resident of the Southern Tier town of Norwich, the former stock car driver served as a campaign co-chairman and ambassador to upstate. JOE HOLLAND Harlem lawyer and entrepreneur who owns an ice cream parlor and founded a homeless shelter. Wanted to run for Attorney General but lost at the state Republican convention to Dennis C. Vacco, then played the good soldier by becoming co-chairman of the Pataki campaign. CHARLES GARGANO D'Amato fund raiser who helped Mr. Pataki raise $13 million, enough to outspend an incumbent Governor. LIBBY PATAKI The only Pataki adviser who the Governor-elect met while body surfing in a hurricane off Long Island. Wife and best friend since 1973. Mother of four little Patakis. Her first advice: take a vacation. He listened.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"G.O.P.'s Rising Star Pledges To Right Wrongs of the Left","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/1994-elections-leaders-gop-leader-gop-s-rising-star-pledges-right-wrongs-left.html","abstract":"  The former history teacher said it felt weird to be making history.

In recent years, Mr. Lubovitch's versatility has obscured his true calling, which is putting movement together with the mastery of someone who recognizes the passion of pure dancing. \"A Brahms Symphony,\" created in 1985, is a virtual surge of sweeping movement, while \"Fandango\" (1990) is the opposite, an erotic duet whose shapes are intricately pieced together, jigsaw-style.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"City Hospitals Avoid Layoffs And Make Severance Offers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/nyregion/city-hospitals-avoid-layoffs-and-make-severance-offers.html","abstract":"  Mayor Rudolph W.

It is 1969. A cargo plane carrying members of a jazz ensemble has been diverted to the outback for an unscheduled layover. As the villagers stare, dumbfounded, seven musicians file onto the runway and give an impromptu jazz concert.

Set in Romania in 1925, the film begins with scenes of cosmopolitan decadence, jazz-age glamour and fierce political undercurrents. On their way to a glittering, fancy-dress ball, Romanian army officers stop by a brothel, where they beat the women yelling antimilitary slogans at them. Next, Kristin Scott-Thomas (the sophisticate from \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\") arrives at the ball. She plays the beautiful, elegant Marie-Therese Von Debretsy Dumitriu, a woman with bobbed hair, diaphanous dresses and an unaccountably graceful smile. As Marie-Therese dances, an elderly relative at the party describes her background.   Her wealthy father turned over his land to the Communists when the revolution approached, but was killed anyway, and Marie-Therese was saved from poverty by her marriage to Petre Dumitriu (Claudiu Bleont), a short, fussy officer with a monocle. Raised in London, she speaks, as her relative points out, \"perfect Romanian with a ghastly Oxford accent.\" Her life is soon to change again, but her elegance never leaves her or this evocative film by Lucian Pintilie. Like its heroine, the film's serene and beautiful appearance masks a powerful conscience.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941111","headline":"After Big Victory, Sri Lankan Says She'll Resume Rebel Talks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/world/after-big-victory-sri-lankan-says-she-ll-resume-rebel-talks.html","abstract":"  After overwhelming her opponent in Sri Lanka's presidential election by a margin of more than two million votes, Prime Minister Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said today that she would resume talks with the Tamil Tigers rebels to try to end the country's 11-year-old civil war.

Repeal poses two threats: The tax will yield $2.7 billion this year, more than one-quarter of the $9.4 billion budget. Mr. Rowland maintains that he can offset half the revenue loss with spending cuts that will not cut services -- a dubious proposition -- and that healthier economic activity will offset the other half.

With more than 70 works, a vast majority of them bronzes, that together span nearly five decades, this exhibition lacks the sharp focus of its predecessors (especially the Yoshii show, which presented a rare and touching view of the artist as a young sculptor). Nor is its synopsis complete: although it includes the haunting 1932 masterpiece \"Woman With Her Throat Cut,\" it passes rather lightly over the artist's Surrealist period of the late 1920's and early 30's and has nothing in plaster or wood, his frequent materials during those years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941111","headline":"1944: New Nazi Weapon : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/opinion/IHT-1944-new-nazi-weapon-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - [From our New York edition:] A story old in this country became a new story for the world today [Nov. 10] when Prime Minister Churchill said in a speech in the House of Commons that German long-range rocket bombs - in German \"Vergeltungswaff","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941111","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/style/chronicle-798886.html","abstract":"  There are scholarships for people who study Chinese history, brain surgery, chemical engineering . . . and now, for those who want to design perfume bottles.

Daniel, a year and a half into the race, has finally hit its stride.    \"Four stars?\" asks a friend one morning. It is 8 A.M., and he is calling to say thank you for the dinner we finished a mere seven hours earlier.   \"I have never had a better dinner,\" he says, dreamily recalling ethereal linguine topped with slender shavings of white truffle. \"If I concentrate,\" he adds, \"I can still smell the truffles and feel those noodles dissolving in my mouth like gossamer ribbons. What a meal!\"   \"Can't we talk later?\" I ask crossly. But he is busy remembering a veloute filled with plump caviar-topped oysters, butter-drenched leeks and sea urchin roe. The voluptuous flavors were rich and decadent, so that the hint of lemongrass in the cream soup combined with the bracing taste of caviar to deliver a gentle shock. \"It was perfect!\" my friend insists. \"Aren't you going to give them four stars?\"   \"I don't know,\" I say. \"I have to go back a few more times.\"   \"But was there anything wrong with the meal?\" he wants to know. I pull the covers over my head and think for a moment. I hope he'll hang up. No such luck.   \"They were nice to me when I walked in the door,\" he says, \"and it was abundantly clear that I was not one of their regular customers. All my clothes put together did not cost as much as one of those custom-made shirts the other men were wearing. And although neither of us had a single piece of jewelry, the hostess could not have been more welcoming.\"   \"Didn't you think the bar we waited in was awfully small and crowded?\" I ask. \"Our knees were hitting those of the people next to us. I thought it was uncomfortable.\"   \"O.K.,\" he admits, \"it was small. But they made up for it by bringing out that plate of lovely little cheese puffs.\"   \"They're called gougeres,\" I can't resist saying.   \"Whatever,\" he says. \"They were delicious. And we only had to wait seven minutes for our table. I timed it.\"   \"But didn't you think the dining room was awfully noisy?\" I persist grumpily.    He has to concede the point; the dining room was crowded, and noisier than it should have been. \"On the other hand,\" he reminds me, \"you said you thought the flowers were fabulous.\"   They were. The drama of the flower arrangements dominates the restaurant, transforming a bland beige room into a place with personality. There are no windows, but the flowers announce the seasons and set the stage for the food with designs so spectacular you find yourself rushing in the door to look at them.    \"And you liked the service,\" he prods. He is right about that, too: the service that night was smooth and sweet, more like that in a stately mansion than a large restaurant. It was formal, thoughtful and not at all stuffy. The waiter passed the amuses gueules as if he were serving at a dinner party, urging us to eat the tiny crab spring rolls and mushroom toasts while they were still hot. One day at lunch, two Brazilian runners were seated at the next table. Before they had finished their meal, the waiter had not only offered tips for tourists in New York, but also convinced them that Daniel would be the perfect place to carbo-load before the marathon; the chef, he assured them, would be happy to create some special pasta dishes.   \"Remember the nine-herb ravioli?\" my friend asks now. Who could forget it? The floppy squares of pasta were filled with a bright green puree of herbs and painted with a vivid red coulis. Colorful leaves of herbs were scattered across the top with fragrant bits of toasted pine nuts and shavings of cheese.   \"And the wild hare stew?\" he asks. At that I sit up and sniff the air. I do remember the civet de lievre. Its deep red wine sauce was thickened with blood and a touch of chocolate; it was so rich and exotic I was seduced into taking one bite and then another as I tried to chase the flavors back to their source. Served with a puree of chestnuts and the roasted loin stuffed with porcini mushrooms, the stew was a masterpiece of hearty regional cooking.    Daniel Boulud was, for 6 years, the much-acclaimed chef at Le Cirque, but in his own restaurant he is working with a new confidence. He seems to be cooking for himself with a menu that offers both hearty French food and classic cooking so technically proficient it takes your breath away.   Chilled lobster consomme is a tour de force. The soup is as clear as crystal but so expressive of lobster that if you close your eyes and take a bite you are surprised to find your mouth filled with liquid. The soup, decorated with rounds of lobster topped with creme fraiche and caviar, is dotted with coral cream when it is served. This is an astonishing dish worthy of a temple of haute cuisine. Still, if you want to continue with a less complicated course, you could order something as down-to-earth as tripes gratinees, hearty cuisine bourgeoise that would be at home in a great country bistro.    Mr. Boulud also offers a changing celebration of the seasons: daily specials that depend on little more than great ingredients. One might be the simple luxury of a large yellow potato mashed with lots of butter and fresh truffles, another an abundance of porcini sauteed in clarified butter, sprinkled with bits of rock salt and a small shower of herbs.   \"And wasn't that foie gras fantastic?\" my friend asks, reminding me of the way the unctuous liver had been balanced by the austerity of fresh quince. Fully awake at last, I begin to revel in last night's dinner as my friend and I start shouting the names of dishes, giddily recapturing a cornucopia of flavors.   \"Pumpkin soup!\" I say, recalling the bright orange puree anchored by a small mound of grated squash topped with black trumpet mushrooms, tiny bits of bacon and crunchy little pumpkin seeds.   \"Steamed skate!\" he cries, and in my mind I can see a broth the color of clover, and feel the way the corduroy texture of the fish was emphasized by the soft lobster dumplings in watercress-lobster broth.   \"Quail salad!\" I say, thinking about a lunch when I was served the most appealing salad I can remember. Leaves of mache were topped with a pair of tiny fried quail eggs and laced with velvety strips of foie gras, silky pieces of grilled quail breast and rough shavings of Parmesan cheese.   \"And the wine!\" my friend says, reminding me of the sommelier's suggestions from that list of fabulous and fabulously expensive bottles. We had settled on a '91 Chassagne-Montrachet from Colin followed by a wonderfully plummy '89 Bon Pasteur.   \"Desserts,\" my friend says now, almost reverently. Together we recite the sweets of the evening, like children recalling Halloween treats. I liked a fruit soup that looked like a reverse sunset, a mint green verbena ice-cream sun setting in a magenta wine-poached pear. He liked the gratin of chocolate, a slim disk of warm chocolate on a fragile sugar wafer. We both loved the creme brulee with macerated strawberries, and were charmed by the finale, a plate of petits fours with its fanciful pulled-sugar birds and flowers.   \"So?\" says my friend. \"Four stars?\"   \"It was a great meal,\" I concede, pushing back the covers, \"but I still have to go back and see if Daniel can sustain that level of cooking.\"   Five meals later, it is clear that the restaurant can. I have had an occasional disappointment: a salty soup, a 15-minute wait for dinner, a lost reservation at lunch. But even on an off day, the restaurant is so exciting that you wake up the morning after a meal at Daniel eager to remember every bite.   It's quite a ride.

Bernard Eloy -- butcher, baker, omelet maker and more -- presides over his empire as a warm, beaming paterfamilias, welcoming diners, recommending his specialties and offering the joyous invitation to eat, eat, eat.   Chez Bernard is not strictly a restaurant. In fact, most of this bright, airy room is given over to display cases showing off Mr. Eloy's bountiful meats, charcuterie and confections; the cafe seats only about 20. Three small tables line one wall, but the cafe is dominated by a large farmhouse table that seats up to 14, contributing to the family feeling of the place. If it were legal to allow dogs in restaurants in New York City, as it is in Paris, they would be right at home here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941111","headline":"Clinton Picks New Director of AIDS Policy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/us/clinton-picks-new-director-of-aids-policy.html","abstract":"  President Clinton today named Patricia S.

Errol Marklein, a 35-year-old elite wheelchair competitor from Germany, completed the 26.2-mile course in 2 hours 8 minutes 36 seconds.     Marklein's time was more than three quarters of an hour faster than the previous New York record, 2:55, set last year by Bob Neumayer, a perennial New York winner. Neumayer cut 23 minutes off his previous best by finishing third in 2:37, 5 minutes behind David Maccaccman of New Zealand.

The gap will make it that much harder for Mr. Pataki to deliver his promised tax cuts.   According to sources in the Cuomo administration, as well as outside budget-watchers, revenues in the fiscal year beginning next April 1 are likely to fall short of projected spending by about $4 billion. Mr. Pataki must find ways to close that gap before he presents his first budget. Having promised lower taxes, he will presumably try to balance the books with spending cuts and restraints, and by revenue growth from a healthier economy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941112","headline":"Sorry, Ernie.
