By chance, someone happened to move their bomb-laden briefcase, and the Fuhrer was only wounded as walls shook in his underground command post in East Prussia. Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, the chief conspirator, had already left the room. On hearing the blast, he mistakenly assumed Hitler was dead and sped to Berlin to spur the revolt, only to be arrested and summarily executed later that day.    The July 20 plot was a noble failure, an honorable treason. Yet in a profound but poignant sense the failure triumphed. Nothing better became the conspirators than their demeanor when they were arrested, tortured, tried before a ranting Nazi judge and then strangled slowly with piano wire -- much of this filmed for Hitler's gratification. Of the nearly 200 principals who were thus executed, none recanted; several thousand other suspects were later convicted in civilian courts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940725","headline":"Elton John and Billy Joel: So Alike, So Different","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/25/arts/pop-review-elton-john-and-billy-joel-so-alike-so-different.html","abstract":"  When Elton John and Billy Joel performed together on Friday night at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., in the first of five sold-out shows ending this Friday, the concert began more like a diplomatic meeting than a pop music performance.

A BATTLE OVER WIND-SHEAR RADAR   Long Island residents, backed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, have forced the Federal Aviation Administration to abandon the two sites it had chosen for huge radar towers to monitor wind conditions at Kennedy and La Guardia Airports. Now the Senator is sponsoring legislation that would direct the administration to begin testing an alternative system at the airports themselves -- a system that he says is smaller, cheaper and safer.

In their overall configuration, our death penalty statutes facially satisfy the constitutional requirements of the Eighth and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution. The multitiered pyramid meets the prerequisite of consistency and reliability by guiding the capital sentencer's discretion with clear and objective standards that narrow the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty and by providing a meaningful basis for distinguishing between those cases in which the death penalty is imposed and those in which it is not. The third tier in the pyramid meets the individualization prerequisite by requiring the sentencer to consider any relevant mitigating information so as to enable the sentencer to make the reasoned moral judgment that death is the appropriate punishment in a particular case.                      . . .         We must therefore decide whether contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms compel the conclusion that any death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The question is not whether any one of us would vote to enact a death penalty if our role were that of a legislator. It is, rather, whether the defendant is correct in his contention that the death penalty is so inherently cruel and so lacking in moral and sociological justification that it is unconstitutional on its face because it is fundamentally offensive to evolving standards of human decency. Stated so categorically, we are unpersuaded by the defendant's contention. Judicial evaluation of evolving standards of human decency cannot proceed in a vacuum. Community standards of acceptable legislative policy choices are necessarily reflected in the text of our constitutional document, in our history and in the teachings of our sister states as well as that of the Federal courts. While we should not blindly follow a beaten path, we agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court's cogent observation: \"When, in the course of a decade, 37 states call for the death penalty, the probability that the legislature of each state accurately reflects its community's standards approaches certainty.\" State v.

On the surface this is a typically eclectic American company, with a diversity of style reflected in its two programs here. Still, George Balanchine remains the father of classical dance in the United States, and the Balanchine connection in San Francisco is especially strong, with two longtime New York City Ballet dancers as artistic directors: Lew Christensen, who died in late 1984, and Helgi Tomasson.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940727","headline":"A Film Hit and a Star Do Wonders for 'Gump'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/27/movies/book-notes-a-film-hit-and-a-star-do-wonders-for-gump.html","abstract":"  Before it was an enormously successful movie whose sentimentality charmed audiences (and irritated many critics), \"Forrest Gump\" was just a novel, and not a very well-known one.

Loew's Valencia became an evangelical church. Mr. Harris became a hard-working celebrity evangelist, turning out texts like \"Lucy and Desi,\" \"Gable and Lombard\" and \"Natalie and R. J.,\" and spreading the gospel of revelation and adoration. \"Audrey Hepburn\" is filled with semi-religious chapter titles like \"A Nun in Africa,\" and \"Tending Her Gardens,\" alongside fairy-tale titles like \"Ballerina to Showgirl\" and \"Stardom Beckons.\" This tone worked very nicely in her movies, but applied to her fairly straightforward life, it grows wearing very quickly.
