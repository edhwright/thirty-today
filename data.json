By no reasonable measure does Chief Buthelezi speak for seven million Zulus; nor does his cousin, King Goodwill Zwelithini, who yesterday demanded creation of an independent Zulu nation based on its 1834 borders.

Now, clues to a possible explanation have emerged in the Canadian tundra amid a rush for diamond riches reminiscent of the Yukon gold days of a century ago. Braving a riot of claims, finds and swindles, geologists have been carefully examining the rocky ground and discovering what may prove to be new indicators of diamond-bearing ores. These signs, dikes of ancient lava that are often visible on the earth's surface, could make future prospecting for diamonds easier.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940215","headline":"West, at U.N., Warns Serbs Of Its Resolve to Use Force","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/15/world/west-at-un-warns-serbs-of-its-resolve-to-use-force.html","abstract":"  The United States, with support from Britain, France and most other Security Council members, sought today to convince Serbian forces ringing the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo that they really do face immediate retaliatory air strikes if they shell the city again or fail to meet NATO's deadline for removing their heavy weapons.   At the start of a two-day public debate on the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, these three countries, as well as the many nonmembers who spoke, said they were also trying to stiffen the resolve of the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and his representatives on the ground who must request the strikes if the Serbs have not complied with NATO's ultimatum by Feb. 21. 'Force Plus Diplomacy'    \"The objective of peace cannot be achieved by diplomacy alone,\" said the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K.

As a traffic accident it wasn't bad, one of the superstitious coaches said, but as an omen it might be.   \"We will see tonight if it's bad luck,\" said Tamara Moskvina, who coaches the 1992 Olympic champions, Natalya Mishkutienok and Artur Dmitriev.   Even before the accident, Moskvina had her suspicions that Mishkutienok and Dmitriev would not repeat as gold medalists. Their gymnastic, innovative style has never seemed to impress judges as much as the lilting harmony and husband-and-wife artistry of Yekaterina Gordeyeva and Sergei Grinkov, the 1988 champions.   \"I think the inclination is not toward my couple,\" she said.   Moskvina was right. Gordeyeva and Grinkov strayed from perfection in tonight's long program, with the normally steady Grinkov struggling through two jumps. But the pair won a second Olympic title, receiving a perfect score of 6.0 from the Russian judge, and 5.9's from the other eight judges for artistic impression. Mishkutienok and Dmitriev won the silver. A Russian pair has now won the gold medal for the ninth straight Winter Olympics.   Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler of Canada won the bronze medal. Eisler later complained about a new rule that allowed professional skaters such as the gold and silver medalists to regain their amateur status for the Olympics.   \"I don't agree they should be back,\" Eisler said. \"Tonight, we're the gold medal winners.\"   \"I'm a skater; I skate,\" Dmitriev said.   Clearly, Dmitriev and Mishkutienok won the crowd's favor, as they had done in the short program on Sunday. They performed more difficult jumps and more creative spins, but, in the end, the competition distilled itself to a matter of style. And the judges, especially the American judge, Elaine DeMore, preferred the balletic unison and classic line and of Gordeyeva and Grinkov to the engaging inventiveness of Dmitriev and Mishkutienok.   \"The panel could have gone either way,\" said John Nicks, coach of the American pair, Jenni Meno and Todd Sand of Costa Mesa, Calif., who skated another consistent program and finished an encouraging fifth. \"The winning side made a couple of minor errors, but I think they won because of their general approach to skating. They are what I would call a purist's pair.\"   There was one scary moment in the competition, when Mandy Woetzel of Germany fell during a spiral maneuver and bounced hard off the ice with her chest and chin. She was carried from the rink by her partner, Ingo Steuer. Woetzel received three stitches in her chin, but did not suffer any broken ribs or require hospitalization. After a short pause, the competition resumed and headed toward the much-anticipated showdown between the gold medalists from the previous two Olympics. Newfound Maturity    Gordeyeva was only 16 and Grinkov was 21 when they won their first gold medal at Calgary in 1988. She is 22 now, the mother of a young daughter named Daria. Gordeyeva brings a newfound maturity to her skating, and she has become a more impressive jumper. She has a presence that forces all eyes on her, and Grinkov, her husband, has the self-assurance to restrain himself in a supporting role. When they are at their best, he is all but invisible.   Tonight, though, his minor faults kept intruding on their lilting routine, skated to Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata.\" Grinkov lost his balance on a double flip jump, and he reduced an intended double salchow to a single. Gordeyeva lurched forward while landing a throw double axel, but otherwise she was flawless. Their unison was never in more brilliant display than when they spun, side by side, fast, then slow, their bodies remaining in perfect unison.   Mishkutienok and Dmitriev are polar opposites to Gordeyeva and Grinkov. Dmitriev is built like a tight end, Mishkutienok is as much a gymnast as a skater. She grabbed her left leg and held it above her head on one spin, then inverted herself, her head at his skates, for another maneuver that has come to be known as the Natalya Death Spin.   They are full of emotion and expressiveness; near the end of tonight's program, they skated to Rachmaninoff's piano concerto No. 2, Dmitriev ripped a flap from the front of his black bodysuit, revealing a red patch apparently meant to signify his passionate heart. The audience loved it, but the judges weren't buying it. Only one of nine placed them ahead of Gordeyeva and Grinkov.   \"It is the eternal question between lyrics and physics,\" Moskvina said.   A question that was answered again in the favor of Gordeyeva and Grinkov.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940216","headline":"Woman Pitches and Wins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/16/sports/sports-people-college-baseball-woman-pitches-and-wins.html","abstract":"  Freshman ILA BORDERS became the first woman to pitch in a National Collegiate Athletic Association or National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics college baseball game yesterday, and she was a rousing success.

Just ask the out-of-town businessman who bought the plantation and is now trying to evict the church, bringing down the wrath of an unlikely alliance whose most visible members are black parishioners and white dowagers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940216","headline":"2 U.S. Women Earn a Final Shot in Mogul Event","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/16/sports/winter-olympics-notebook-2-us-women-earn-a-final-shot-in-mogul-event.html","abstract":"  She was not the post-operative wonder who has dominated the moguls circuit this season, but Donna Weinbrecht, the defending Olympic champion, was more than good enough today to qualify for the final round Wednesday.

The declaration triggers a several-months' process during which the U.S. will prepare a list of sanctions.   The declaration is fully justified. Japan has systematically thwarted promises it made under the accord. Five years later Motorola, a technological leader around the world, accounts for less than 2 percent of the Tokyo-Nagoya market. Sanctions are also warranted: because telecommunications services are not covered by international treaty, the U.S. has no good recourse other than to retaliate unilaterally.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940216","headline":"In 'Catch-22' Sequel, Heller Brings Back Yossarian, Milo, et al.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/16/books/in-catch-22-sequel-heller-brings-back-yossarian-milo-et-al.html","abstract":"  Thirty-three years after publishing \"Catch-22,\" the novel whose title became an enduring part of the lexicon and whose bitter satire helped change America's view of war, Joseph Heller has written a sequel that promises to reveal what has become of characters like Yossarian and Milo Minderbinder.

Mr. Bluiett's sound is heavy, as if it had been made under compression, and at the Village Vanguard on Tuesday night he didn't even bother to use a microphone. He just let his sound jump out into the room and take over.   Mr. Bluiett's engagement at the Vanguard, continuing through Sunday, is rare on two counts: he hardly ever leads a band in New York, and he's playing with a rhythm section that, for him, is surprisingly conventional. Though Mr. Bluiett has led a big band and worked with Charles Mingus, he is best known for his role in founding the World Saxophone Quartet and for his connections to jazz's avant-garde. He should use a traditional band more often. In his first set, on two ballads, \"I'll Close My Eyes\" and \"Sophisticated Lady,\" Mr. Bluiett, with his sure command of drama, made a case for himself as one of the better ballad players in jazz.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940217","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/17/nyregion/c-corrections-206156.html","abstract":"  A picture caption yesterday about clashes in the Gaza Strip referred incorrectly in some editions to the site of a Palestinian death.

But on Tuesday night, it was the slightly younger band, Motorhead, that sounded old-fashioned, while Black Sabbath remained streamlined and efficient.   \"Here's a song you know very well,\" Black Sabbath's vocalist, Tommy Martin, kept saying with variations throughout the band's set. Black Sabbath relies, wisely, on material from its first decade, when Ozzy Osbourne was its lead singer and the band was inventing a school of heavy metal. Black Sabbath mixed bulldozing, stop-start riffs, histrionic high-tenor singing and lyrics that veered from tortured idealism to visions of Satanic rituals.

One Definition of 'Control'    As two sophisticated French radar systems and 450 more United Nations troops arrived here to help monitor a shaky cease-fire, people close to the negotiations indicated that the United Nations was insisting that \"control\" means that Serbs surrender physical possession of any artillery and tanks they do not withdraw from the mountains ringing the besieged city.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940217","headline":"Sports of The Times; Olympics Should Be Rated 'R'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/17/sports/sports-of-the-times-olympics-should-be-rated-r.html","abstract":"  NOW that Tonya Harding has landed the most difficult jump of her skating life -- the Continental Double Cross -- she ought to finally be appreciated by all, if only because her arrival here yesterday keeps Michelle Kwan down on the Oslo farm.

The Brentano String Quartet made an irresistible case for itself at its New York debut on Tuesday evening at Merkin Concert Hall. Its players -- Mark Steinberg and Serena Canin, violinists; Misha Amory, violist, and Michael Kannen, cellist -- have all attracted attention as soloists in recent seasons. Together, they produce a magnificently blended sound with a remarkable coloristic range.    The concert was presented by the Guild of Composers, so the focus was on contemporary works, with early Berg and late Beethoven providing depth of perspective. Seymour Shifrin's Quartet No. 5 (1975) opened the program. Nearly 20 years after its composition, the work's language -- gracefully angular, scampering, sometimes sensuous, sometimes eerie -- seems quaint and almost nostalgic.

His melodies, too, reflect Celtic modal scales and the rhythms of jigs and reels and strathspeys. But Mr. Thompson's traditionalism is hot-wired with modern elements: the verse-chorus-bridge structures of pop songs, Chuck Berry guitar licks, harmonies that wander where folk songs never strayed, and lyrics that recognize a modern, urban world. In \"Easy There, Steady Now,\" the singer sees his love life reflected in a jackknifed tractor-trailer accident.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940217","headline":"Harding Arrives And Greets Kerrigan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/17/sports/winter-olympics-harding-arrives-and-greets-kerrigan.html","abstract":"  Tonya Harding arrived at the Olympics today and, just as officials worried about keeping her and Nancy Kerrigan apart, the two skaters met briefly in the athletes' village before a team picture was taken.   \"They came up to each other and said, 'Hi,' and spoke three or four sentences; it was very pleasant, very good,\" said Gale Tanger, team leader of the United States figure skating team. \"I think Nancy came up first.

Opposition From Judges    In December the Court of Appeals surprised law-enforcement officials with a novel interpretation of the state drug laws: To prove that a suspect knowingly possessed a certain amount of drugs, the court ruled, a prosecutor needs to show not only that the suspect carried the drugs, but also that he knew the approximate weight of the drugs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940217","headline":"Review/Dance; Going Against the Grain, With Stephen Foster in Tow","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/17/arts/review-dance-going-against-the-grain-with-stephen-foster-in-tow.html","abstract":"  The opening of the Feld Ballets/NY on Tuesday night with the premiere of \"Doo Dah Day,\" Eliot Feld's sardonic nontribute to Stephen Foster, vividly recalled the unpredictability of the choreographer's career.
