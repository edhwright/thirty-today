The saxophonist Illinois Jacquet was the last of the instrumental stars of the swing era to form his own big band. It happened 10 years ago when he was invited to give a series of master classes at Harvard University and found that his students were eager to know about the big-band era, which had ended more than 35 years earlier. Drawing on his experience as a sideman in the big bands led by Lionel Hampton, Cab Calloway and Count Basie, Mr. Jacquet put together the band he has led ever since. Its performance for dancing tomorrow at the Fountain Plaza will be the last of this season's Mid-Summer Night Swing sessions at Lincoln Center. Music starts at 8:15 P.M. Admission is $7.50, or $6.50 with any Citibank card or New York Transit Authority 10-pack token wrapper. Jarvis and Hinton    Jane Jarvis and Milt Hinton, Zinno, 126 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-5182). For 24 years, Jane Jarvis played the organ at baseball parks (eight years with the Milwaukee Braves and 16 years for the New York Mets). At the same time, for 18 of those years she was producing elevator and supermarket music for Muzak until, in the late 1970's, she dropped these disguises and revealed herself as a jazz pianist strongly influenced by Mary Lou Williams, Earl Hines and Duke Ellington. When she got her first engagement at Zinno 10 years ago, the celebrated bassist Milt Hinton joined her. He has been with her for many of her engagements there for the past decade. They will be together once more tonight and tomorrow; the first of their four 40-minute sets begins at 8 P.M. There is a music charge of $5 and a food and drink minimum of $15 in the Music Room, where dinner is served, and a $10 drink minimum at the bar.  Guises of Golson    Benny Golson Quartet, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, East Village (212) 533-7900. Benny Golson moves fast and frequently and in a variety of guises. He is a saxophonist, a composer, a band leader and a writer of scores for films and television, talents that are usually mingled in whatever he may be doing. This weekend at Fat Tuesday's, he will draw to some extent on all of his talents. He will not actually compose a film or television score but his program may include material he wrote for scores for \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Mission Impossible\" or \"Ironside\"; songs he wrote or arranged for Ella Fitzgerald, Mama Cass, Eartha Kitt and Diana Ross, and his now-classic jazz compositions (\"I Remember Clifford,\" \"Whisper Not\" and \"Stablemates\"). And he will introduce the latest in a line of groups that began in 1959, when he shared leadership in the Art Farmer-Benny Golson Jazztet. This one is a quartet featuring a fresh talent, Kevin Hayes, on piano, and two solidly established sidemen: the bassist Rufus Reid and the drummer Marvin (Smitty) Smith. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10 and midnight, 8 and 10 P.M. on Sunday. There is a $17.50 music charge and a $7 minimum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930723","headline":"Reviews/Art; In Connecticut, Clothes, Photos and a Yale on Yale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/23/arts/reviews-art-in-connecticut-clothes-photos-and-a-yale-on-yale.html","abstract":"  From Stamford to Hartford and at points in between, the summer art season in Connecticut includes a provocative look at contemporary art that uses clothing as a metaphor, an examination of the influence of the 19th-century photographer Eadweard Muybridge, a celebration of an important university art program and a consideration of the work of an American master.

Pierce's strong volley and corner shots overpowered McCarthy and gave her trouble throughout the match.   \"It was more or less a combination of my strong shots and her short shots that helped me win,\" said Pierce, appearing in her first tournament without her father present. \"Today I played surprisingly well, and I think she played a little short.\"   Jim Pierce, who has served as his daughter's coach, was banned by the Women's Tennis Council from attending any more events on the tour after an altercation at the French Open.   In doubles, top-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez and Patti O'Reilly defeated Ida Khalatian and Lillianana Manoukian, 6-1, 6-2. In the first doubles match of the tournament, Louise Field and Tracey Morton defeated Elise Burgin and Joann Russel, 6-1, 6-3. In a quarterfinal, Fernandez defeated fifth seeded O'Reilly of Ridgewood, N.J., 6-1, 6-1. Lisa Raymond beat Mercedes Paz of Argentina, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930723","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/23/nyregion/c-corrections-336493.html","abstract":"  An article and a picture caption in Business Day yesterday about executive changes at the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation referred incorrectly to the company's chairman and chief executive in some editions.

Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, cited several instances in the 1980's when the Supreme Court \"cut back on the legal protections against job discrimination.\" He then asked Judge Ginsburg to discuss her view of the Court majority's approach to construing civil rights laws in those cases.   JUDGE GINSBURG My view of the civil rights laws conforms to my views concerning statutory interpretation generally -- that is, it is the obligation of judges to construe statutes in the way that Congress meant them to be construed. Some statutes, not simply in the civil rights area but the anti-trust area, are meant to be broad charters: the Sherman Act. The Civil Rights Act states grand principles representing the highest aspirations of our nation to be a nation that is open and free, where all people will have opportunity.   And that spirit imbues that law, just as free competition is the spirit in the antitrust laws, and the courts construe statutes in accord with the essential meaning that Congress had for passing them.                    . . .         Q.  I note that in a 1979 speech at a colloquium on legislation for women's rights you stated that \"I think discrimination based on sexual orientation should be deplored.\" . . . I'd like to ask you whether you still believe, as you did in 1979, that \"discrimination based on sexual orientation should be deplored.\"   A.  I think rank discrimination against anyone is against the tradition of the United States and is to be deplored. Rank discrimination is not part of our nation's culture. Tolerance is. And a generous respect for differences based on -- this country is great because of its accommodation of diversity.    I mean, the first thing that I noticed when I came back to the United States from a prolonged stay in Sweden -- and after I was so accustomed to looking at people whose complexion was the same -- and I took my first ride on a New York subway and I thought, What a wonderful country we live in -- people who are so different in so many ways and yet we, for the most part, get along with each other. The richness of the diversity of this country is a treasure, and it's a constant challenge, too, to remain tolerant and respectful of one another.    Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, noted later that the courts had frequently deferred to military regulations far more restrictive than would be permitted in civilian law. He then referred to Judge Ginsburg's earlier testimony that she found \"rank discrimination\" deplorable and asked her precisely what she meant by the term.   A.  Yes. I think base discrimination is deplorable and against the spirit of this country -- discrimination, arbitrary discrimination without reason.   Q.  No. Does \"rank\" mean institutional discrimination? Does it mean intentional discrimination? Does it mean arbitrary discrimination? Because as I understand the Constitution, it is permissible to discriminate or to classify provided there is a rational basis for it.    A.  If I discriminated against some person for reasons that are irrelevant to that person's talent or ability, that is what I meant when I said rank discrimination: arbitrary discrimination that's unrelated to a person's ability or worth, unrelated to a person's talent; discrimination because -- simply because of who that person is and not what that person can do.   Q.  Or does? Or does? In other words, do you draw it upon that person's status or conduct? Would it be a difference, in your judgment?    A.  A person's birth status should be -- should not enter into the way that person is treated. The person who is born into a certain home with a certain religion or is born of a certain race, those are irrelevant characteristics to what that person can do or contribute to society.   Q.  What about sexual orientation?   A.  Senator, you know that that is a burning question that at this very moment is going to be before the Court, based on an action that has been taken. I cannot say one word on that subject that would not violate what I said had to be my rule about no hints, no forecasts, no previews.   Q.  Well, it seemed to me that you already did comment on that when you responded to Senator Kennedy this morning. He talked about race, religion, and gender and sexual orientation, and I think your comment was rank discrimination is deplorable under all of those circumstances.   A.  I think rank discrimination for any reason -- hair color, eye color, you name it -- rank discrimination is un-American for whatever reason. If you have a classification, there has to be a reason, as you said, for any classification.   On Capital Punishment   Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, asked Judge Ginsburg whether she believed, \"as Justices Brennan and Marshall did,\" that the death penalty was incompatible with the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.   A.  At least since 1976, and possibly if you date it from Furman and earlier, the Supreme Court by large majorities has rejected the position that the death penalty under any and all circumstances is unconstitutional.   I recognize that there is no judge on the Court that takes a position that the death penalty is unconstitutional under any and all circumstances; all of the Justices on the Court have rejected that view. There are many questions left unresolved. They are coming constantly before that Court. I think at least two are before the Court next year.   I can tell you that I have -- I do not have a closed mind on this subject. I don't want to commit my -- I don't think it would be consistent with the line I have tried to hold to tell you that I would definitely accept or definitely reject any position. I can tell you that I am well aware of the precedent, and I have already expressed my views on the value of precedent.    Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, cited Herrera v. Collins, in which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the majority, \"was unable to declare clearly and unequivocally that the Constitution forbids the execution of innocent people.\" He asked Judge Ginsburg, \"Do you believe the Herrera case stands for the principle that it is unconstitutional to execute an innocent person?\"    A.  As I understand it -- and the case is not fresh in my mind -- what the Court said was that the evidence in that case was insufficient to show innocence. It did not rule out a different ruling in a case with a stronger record. We heard yesterday from Senator Feinstein, who was expressing her anxiety with the number of cases that go on for years and years.   The colloquy that is occurring here is showing the tremendous tensions and difficulties in this area. Her anxious plight was there must be a time when the curtain is drawn, and your anxiety is that no innocent person should ever be put to death. Those tensions are coming before you, some of them, in the Powell Commission report that you are going to have to address.    My understanding of Herrera is it's concerned with the situation that someone could say, 10 years after a conviction and multiple appeals, \"I didn't do it,\" and then the process would start all over again. I can empathize tremendously with the concern.                    . . .         What the Court said -- and this is to the best of my recollection -- that the evidence was too slim in Herrera to make out that claim, and it left the door open to a case where there was stronger evidence of innocence. That case is yet to come before the Court in the future. So my understanding of this case is it, based on that particular record, said the evidence was too thin to show innocence, that the Court was leaving open the question of whether you could have such a plea on a stronger showing than the one that was made in that case. And that's as far as the Herrera case went. It just left open a case where a stronger showing could be made.    In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Judge Ginsburg declined to discuss her views on the death penalty because, she said, she had never decided a capital case or written about the subject. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, later reminded her that while practicing law she had written a friend-of-the-court brief in Coker v. Georgia, arguing \"that the death penalty for rape was not constitutional.\"   A.  I did not write about the question we've been addressing about the constitutionality of the death penalty. The Coker-against-Georgia brief was a brief that said the death penalty for rape, where there was no death or serious permanent injury apart from the obvious psychological injury -- that that was disproportionate for this reason: The death penalty for rape historically was part of a view of woman as belonging to man, as first her father's possession. If she were raped before marriage, she was damaged goods and she was not someone -- it was a theft of something that belonged first to the father. And if she were a married woman and she were raped, again she would be regarded as damaged goods.   We've seen that most recently in tragedies in many places in the world, where women in Bangladesh, for example, were discarded, were treated as worthless, because they had been raped. And that was what Coker against Georgia came out of, and that's the whole thrust of that brief, that this was made punishable by death because man's property had been taken from him because of the rape of women. And that was the perspective that was taken in the Coker-against-Georgia brief.    Q.  On page 22 of that brief, a heading underlined says, \"The death sentence for rape is impermissible under the Eighth Amendment because it does not meet 'contemporary standards' regarding the infliction of punishment and is inadvisable since it diminishes legal protection afforded rape victims.\" It seems to me it deals directly with the issue of the Eighth Amendment.   A.  Senator Grassley, I urge you to read the entire Coker-against-Georgia brief. I think you will find it to be exactly what I represented it to be. One of the reasons why rapes went unpunished, why women who had been raped suffered the indignity of having the police refuse to prosecute, was statutes of that order.                    . . .         I've written on the subject of women who have been raped and society's attitude toward them. Coker against Georgia fits into that category, and it must not be taken out of context to say anything about any other subject than the one that was addressed in that brief. And that was that the death penalty for rape -- the origin of that and the perpetuation of it -- was harmful to women, far from resulting in convictions.                    . . .         It was a contribution to the proper way to look at this terrible crime. It was a contribution to the end of thinking of women as damaged goods because they had been raped. That's what I think about it. On Free Expression   Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked whether freedom of expression was still an evolving right under the Constitution.   A.  Free expression, I think, was an idea from the start, even before the limitations on it -- the Alien and Sedition Act, which I think never was reversed by the Supreme Court but certainly has been reversed by the history of our country since that time. The idea was there from the beginning, -- though I mentioned the Revolutionary War cartoon, \"Liberty of speech for those who speak the speech of liberty\" -- the idea was always there. The great opposition to the government as censor was always there.   But it is only in our time that that right has come to be recognized as fully as it is today with the line of cases ending in Brandenburg v. Ohio -- truly recognizes that free speech means not freedom of thought and speech for those with whom we agree, but freedom of expression for the expression we hate. I think that there are always new contexts that will be presented but that the dissenting positions of Holmes and Brandeis have become the law that everyone accepts. I think that is the case today.   Q.  What about in the area of entertainment?    A.  Well, now we're getting into more slippery territory. It depends what kind of entertainment, I suppose. You know that the Supreme Court has a series of decisions about the speech that's in the kind of nether land between fully protected speech and unprotected speech. Indecent speech -- you have -- it's not subject to -- that is within the First Amendment but not entitled to the same level of protection as other speech.   The Supreme Court has had decisions about the -- what do they call? -- adult movie theaters, that those can be zoned for the safety of the neighborhood. They can either be -- a municipality can decide to spread them out so they won't be clustered or can put them all together in one combat zone. So there is a difference between the degree of respect of the kind of knowledge, information -- political speech on the one hand; then, as you know, there is this category of speech that is unprotected by the First Amendment called obscenity. And then there is this category of speech that's not out of the ball park but that is subject to regulation, indecent speech.   That's an area that I can't talk about in specific terms because it is something that is -- has come before my court, is coming before the Supreme Court in connection with broadcast regulation. But I do recognize that there are those -- there is that category of speech that does not get the full protection of the First Amendment but is not left out entirely.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930723","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/23/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Michael Hepher, managing director of BT PLC, is reading \"Prophets in the Dark\" by David T.

In the last year, he has stepped up his criticism, accusing the Government of treating Alaska, the nation's biggest state, like a distant colony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930724","headline":"Head Start, the Whole Story","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/24/opinion/head-start-the-whole-story.html","abstract":"Head Start needs more money.

ANOTHER BOMBING PLOT SUSPECT ARRESTED   An Egyptian welder described as a key conspirator in the foiled plot to bomb four targets in New York City was surprised at a barbecue in a New Jersey seaside motel Thursday night and arrested while trying to flee with an 11-year-old boy he had grabbed, Federal officials have announced.

NEW YORK CITY   REWARD OFFERED IN TOWER BOMBING   Ending a three-month stalemate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Department has offered a reward of up to $2 million for information leading to the arrest of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the main missing suspect in the World Trade Center bombing.

Early estimates put the maximum travel time at about 70 minutes each way.   Page 24.

After mid-century, the world's farmers more than doubled the grain harvest, something no previous generation had done. Raising the harvest from 631 million tons in 1950 to 1,650 million tons in 1984, they increased grain production by 40 percent per person, reducing hunger and malnutrition around the world. Since 1984, however, grain production has fallen behind population growth, falling roughly 1 percent a year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930724","headline":"Custody Case Affirms Biological Ties That Bind; A Child Is Not a Doll","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/24/opinion/l-custody-case-affirms-biological-ties-that-bind-a-child-is-not-a-doll-368393.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As the letter of the law smites the DeBoer family (news article, July 3), where is the wisdom of Solomon?

here at the Pompidou Center is an excellent reminder of why Mr. Morley is a painter painters admire. Partly it is his restless, renegade spirit. You can never be sure what he is going to do next. Partly it is the fact that he brings to his work a combination of ambition and wit and technical derring-do that makes his art compelling even when it is not altogether convincing.   And it's not always convincing, as this simply and handsomely installed show of nearly 60 paintings and sculptures from 1962 to the present (on view through Sept. 19) cannot fail to demonstrate. Yet his up-and-down quality is, in one respect, to Mr. Morley's credit: he is a taker of risks, venturesome not just in the sense that he loves to paint fantastical landscapes and imaginary midair battles that border on the incomprehensible.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"Sports of The Times; Newest Jet Can Cite Montana and Rice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/sports/sports-of-the-times-newest-jet-can-cite-montana-and-rice.html","abstract":"  THIS is not just another football camp.

The day falls on a Sunday in a cyclical pattern of 11, 6, 5 and 6 years -- the last time in 1982, the next time in 1999. While July 25 is a special day, the celebrations go on all year, drawing hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to embrace the statue of St. James that stands over the altar in the cathedral or to pray before the ornate silver urn that is thought to contain his bones.   The difference this year, though, is that the remote and long-backward region of Galicia, which has Santiago as its capital, has decided to use Xacobeo '93 -- St. James's Day in the language of Galicia -- to promote itself and the pilgrims' trail as a tourist destination. The Church is not too happy with the competition.

Cooing and flattering a man are the ways to keep him, the spirit advises. But that advice doesn't pay off. While telling the story, the daughter realizes to her dismay that she has absorbed too many of her mother's feelings that women should be men's angelic supporters and nurturers.    \"I thought I was by myself, but I cannot kill the angel in the house,\" she reflects with some bitterness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"Compact, Versatile And Waterproof","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/style/camera-compact-versatile-and-waterproof.html","abstract":"  THOUGH Pentax did not specifically design its Zoom 90 Weather Resistant 35-millimeter camera to be bomb resistant, it turns out that it is.

The Government sets basic fees for doctors' visits, specialist consultations, surgical procedures. You go to the doctor of your choice. The Government's fee list isn't binding; fancy doctors can charge more, but the patient then has to pick up the difference.   If your doctor bills the Government directly (about 70 percent do), his assistant slips the card through a device just like the ones used for charge cards, and no money changes hands. Otherwise, a typical visit to a family doctor costs about $30, of which Medicare pays about $19. You can go to the doctor, pay and then take the receipt down to your local Medicare office (there's one in every neighborhood and shopping center), present your card and get cash back on the spot. Or you can be billed by the doctor, send the bill to Medicare and receive a check made out to the doctor.   Private insurance companies supplement the public system. Although excellent free treatment is universally available in public hospitals, those who want to choose their own surgeon and stay in private, comfortable-to-luxurious hospitals can go to the private insurers for coverage beyond Medicare. Such a policy for a family costs $1,000 to $2,000 a year.   The system (which also subsidizes most prescriptions) is financed by a flat 1.4 percent levy on income. Most Australians consider it well worth the price. Employers have no role in the system and are thus free to provide other benefits, like a standard six weeks of vacation.   Some savings are built into the system. When a baby is born, for instance, the hospital notifies an infant health center in the family's neighborhood. Within days, the parents are visited by a highly trained nurse. Typically these \"sisters\" try to get to know the mother, offer a phone number where they can be reached for advice on everything from bathing to breast-feeding, and make an appointment for the baby at the health center. These nurses take care of all the baby's routine health needs. Specialist pediatricians only see very sick children.   The most common complaint in Australia about health care is that people must often wait if they want the Government to pay for elective surgery. But it does pay for a huge range of procedures, from plastic surgery to psychotherapy, as long as there's a referral from a general practitioner.   Within a year each state will have a health care ombudsman to handle complaints from the public about doctors or hospitals. Several states have had them for some years. Malpractice suits are rare and the number is not increasing, since more and more are settled by negotiation through the ombudsmen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"Let's Stop Buying a Secret Foreign Policy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/opinion/l-let-s-stop-buying-a-secret-foreign-policy-230593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   We were disappointed by \"Can It Be Happening?\" by A.

Like the older, larger and slightly more formal Stamford establishment (which has a more elaborate menu), Via Sforza has artfully designed its smallish storefront interior to resemble an outdoor scene in Italy, with stuccoed walls with faux windows and doors (and even an advertising poster on one wall). A trellised alcove suggests a cozy grape arbor. In one corner of the dining room, chefs work at an open-to-view brick pizza oven.    Aptly dubbed a trattoria, Via Sforza is casual and informal, drawing heavily on pastas and pizzas, with a short list of seafood, chicken and meat dishes. On the whole, the thin-crusted pizzas are the best bet. While a large one seems pricey at $14, $15 or $16 (depending on the toppings), it can serve at least three ravenous diners. A smaller one (averaging $8) is about right for one, with a salad or starter. Most interesting of the pizzas was quattro stagione: four separate toppings of prosciutto, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and, best of all, capers (inspired!). Napoli, with fresh garlic, scallions and fresh clams, was a pungent treat, while the lighter Margherita, with cheese, basil, tomatoes and olive oil, made a refreshing summer choice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"The Sound Gets Cleaner","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/nyregion/the-sound-gets-cleaner.html","abstract":"  FROM Kristine Fontana's lifeguard chair on the beach at Branford Point, Long Island Sound looked murky.

Art historians can easily trace, for example, what Michelangelo or Raphael gleaned from their less celebrated teachers, or argue that Manet first taught Monet, then wound up learning from his pupil. Artists still go to art school, of course, but the current trend is to regard artists who have gained celebrity status as geniuses or shooting stars on their own individual courses. \n\nAt City Without Walls, there is currently a reminder of the old way. The not-for-profit gallery runs an educational program called Art Reach, one facet of which is the mentor-student program, which pairs a professional Newark-based artist with an outstanding prospect from Newark's Arts High School. The student works as a studio assistant in return for the benefits of the mentor's expertise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"Laura Whitman, Paul Provost","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/style/weddings-laura-whitman-paul-provost.html","abstract":"  Laura Bowne Whitman, the cataloguer of Chinese paintings at Sotheby's in New York, and Paul Raymond Provost, a doctoral candidate in art history at Princeton University, were married yesterday.

Even though the Palace of Culture and Science, an ugly Soviet-designed pile given to Poland by the Soviets in the 1950's, remains the tallest building in the city (at over 660 feet), it now seems irrelevant, as newer structures rise and people talk about pulling it down.   In many ways, Warsaw has been too busy getting on with its own commercial life to bother with tourism. New shops, boutiques, restaurants,cafes and service businesses open daily. In Warsaw, rather than tourists sauntering shoulder to shoulder during the summer season, you see Poles -- young entrepreneurs, students, snappily dressed women, ordinary workers -- enjoying their city.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"Your Home: Salability; A Slovenly House Is A Turn-Off","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/realestate/your-home-salability-a-slovenly-house-is-a-turn-off.html","abstract":"  COOKIE crumbs hang from the upholstery in the family room.

Moreover, what might be the effect if other major groups of people tried to cash in on affirmative action, if indeed they could prove discrimination against members of their groups? For example, on Jan. 19, 1973, the United States Department of Labor published \"Guidelines on Discrimination\" in the Federal Register. It stated in Part (b) 60-50.1 that \"Jews and Catholics, Italians, Greeks, and Slavic groups\" are victims of bias in employment because of their background.

Like the seven deadly sins, despair is a mythical state. It has no quantifiable existence; it is merely part of an allegorical world view, yet no less lethal for that. Unlike other sins, however, despair is by tradition the sole sin that cannot be forgiven; it is the conviction that one is damned absolutely, thus a repudiation of the Christian Saviour and a challenge to God's infinite capacity for forgiveness. The sins for which one may be forgiven -- pride, anger, lust, sloth, avarice, gluttony, envy -- are all firmly attached to the objects of this world, but despair seems to bleed out beyond the confines of the immediate ego-centered self and to relate to no desire, to no thing. The alleged sinner has detached himself even from the possibility of sin, and this the Catholic Church, as the self-appointed voice of God on earth, cannot allow.   Religion is organized power in the seemingly benevolent guise of the sacred, and power is, as we know, chiefly concerned with its own preservation. Its structures, its elaborate rituals and customs and Scriptures and commandments and ethics, its very nature, objectify human experience, insisting that what is out there in the world is of unquestionably greater significance than what is in here in the human spirit. Despair, surely the least aggressive of sins, is dangerous to the totalitarian temperament because it is a state of intense inwardness, thus independence. The despairing soul is a rebel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"In the Region: Long Island; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/realestate/in-the-region-long-island-recent-sales-462093.html","abstract":"  Bay Shore  $131,500   24 Roland Place  4-bedroom, 2-bath, 29- year-old high ranch; dining room, eat-in kitchen, den; taxes $4,700.
