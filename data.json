It was reported by his son, Robb Gordon of Manhattan, who is one of the most successful players in the New York metropolitan area.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930407","headline":"Japan's Leader to Replace Foreign Minister","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/07/world/japan-s-leader-to-replace-foreign-minister.html","abstract":"  One week before Japan is to be host for a high-level international conference on providing aid to Russia, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa decided today to name a relative newcomer to international affairs to replace his ailing Foreign Minister, setting off an intense power struggle in the governing Liberal Democratic Party.

How can we help these vulnerable young women realize that they do not need the physical attention of their male peers to make them popular, accepted or validated? How can we show them there are other sources of healthy physical contact and pleasure? And how can we teach them that they must discover their self-worth within themselves?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930408","headline":"Middle East:Time for Semites to Surmount the Past Together","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/08/opinion/IHT-middle-easttime-for-semites-to-surmount-the-past-together.html","abstract":"As far back as I can remember, they had been a fixture of our life, a vital dimension to our city existence.

Except without the snacks, the commercials, the interruptions to answer the phone, the sound of your neighbor's lawn mower, the familiar couch or, finally, anything that really resembles a television set.   As television has taken over our culture, most of us have come to treat it much as we treat our parents: as a force that is always there, is often distracting, but rarely commands our undivided attention. The museum, where television is an object of research, even reverence, isn't about such heedless intimacy. An afternoon there can thus be a disconcerting -- and oddly revelatory -- experience.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930409","headline":"Historic Day at Bar: Dodger Stays in Brooklyn; Judge Says, Among Other Things, That Los Angeles Club Has No Good Name to Lose","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/09/nyregion/historic-day-bar-dodger-stays-brooklyn-judge-says-among-other-things-that-los.html","abstract":"  Nothing can heal the wound left when the Brooklyn Dodgers packed up their bats and balls and headed to Los Angeles after the 1957 season.

Mr. Pena, a Spanish flamenco guitarist whose exceptional virtuosity is matched by his passion, will present his Gypsy folk Mass, Misa Flamenca, a work that melds the Roman Catholic liturgy with flamenco traditions. In the work, which was created for the Wroclaw Music Festival in Poland, the Gloria has become a fandango and the Eucharist an alegria. The concert will feature Mr. Pena's Flamenco Company, an ensemble of guitarists, vocalists and percussionists, and the Andalusian flamenco dancer Javier Cruz. The Elmer Iseler Singers, a Canadian group, serves as chorus. Show time is tomorrow at 8 P.M., and tickets cost from $23.50 to $25.50. Dixie Carter Sings    Dixie Carter, Cafe Carlyle, Madison Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. No leading cabaret performer dares more and gets away with it than Ms. Carter. This star of \"Designing Women\" comes on as a mature southern belle with a flaming sense of humor and a fearless theatricality. Among the high points of her new act are a rendition of Laura Nyro's \"Sweet Blindness\" in which she sprawls across the piano in a delirious fog of Southern moonshine and a version of Bob Dylan's \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" that gets to the song's chilly, contemptuous essence like no one else's.

Few contemporary writers have produced as many songs that have been embraced as standards by nightclub cognoscenti. Expertly backing himself on piano, he performs them with dry acerbity that treats each witty apercu as a twist of the knife. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:15.

For those who have a taste for such things, Film Forum 2 is offering a program of six animated short films by the Quays, which opens today and plays through Thursday. They range from a recent music video for the singer and songwriter Michael Penn, to \"Anamorphosis,\" a formal examination of perspective in 16th- and 17th-century paintings.   Timothy and Stephen Quay, identical twins who were born in Philadelphia and now live in England, are masters of an eclectic Eastern European mode of Surrealism. Their most experimental films re-imagine the world as a waking nightmare experienced in mysterious, frequently decrepit settings. The puppet figures in a film like \"Street of Crocodiles\" (1986) bob and lurch through spaces so dingy and encrusted with age that they conjure up images of an anguished collective memory, buried but still stirring under a mountain of detritus.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930409","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/09/arts/art-in-review-123093.html","abstract":"   Joan Mitchell   Robert Miller Gallery  41 East 57th Street  Manhattan  Through May 8    This is among the most beautiful gallery shows in a long while and a fitting tribute to one of the leading second-generation Abstract Expressionists. Joan Mitchell died of lung cancer in Paris in October, at the age of 66. These are her last, radiant paintings, remarkable in their diversity of touch, magisterial in their scale and authority. In \"Phyllis,\" the only work on view from 1991, not 1992, Mitchell paints in broad, almost blunt strokes that seem to be pushed and pulled across the canvas. In other paintings, she draws in thin, elegant lines bunched like tangles of streamers, or in bold vertical lines that evoke tall grasses. As free flowing as her paintings can appear, they have about them an extraordinary harmony and structural solidity; they are often in two panels joined together, each panel with its own character and yet inseparable from the other. There is even, in what may be the most comprehensive and brilliant of these paintings, \"Ici,\" a loose grid that binds together the complex jumble of lines and joyously colored patches.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930409","headline":"Cuomo Urges Product-Liability Revisions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/09/nyregion/cuomo-urges-product-liability-revisions.html","abstract":"  In an effort to protect manufacturers from exorbitant legal judgments, Gov.

While polishing the play, he has also put it in context, having added a related one-act, followed by a brief epilogue. The result is a pungent chamber trilogy of character sketches.   In the play, at Manhattan Theater Club's Stage II, the principal character is careering through a crisis.

While this analysis is common among both European citizens and a growing number of Americans, it is flawed.   Even if one accepts the wisdom of military action in this crisis, it is unrealistic to expect the European Community to take charge of such an operation. National governments and national foreign policies are still in control of Europe's foreign policy and have determined Europe's actions toward the former Yugoslavia.    The Community has so far been given almost no power in foreign policy. The European Community commission, the Community's executive authority, has only an advisory role in foreign policy making, and even when the 12 European Community countries try to act together, any member state can veto action.   Perhaps more significant, the European Community countries have no command system for joint military operations outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And Germany, the biggest member state, refuses to send its army outside Western Europe. Imagine what United States foreign policy would be like if it had to depend on the unanimous agreement of 50 governors!   Europe's weakness in the Yugoslav crisis has exposed not the failure of the Community, but the need for it. Europe's national governments have shown themselves incapable of moving beyond narrow national interests to the more global outlook that they could have if their sovereignty was pooled together. The dream of united Europe is not dead, but it risks getting prematurely buried under faulty explanations and exaggerated expectations.  MARK M. NELSON Senior Associate, Carnegie Endowment for Intl.

FAITH STEWART-GORDON, owner of the restaurant where Hollywood and Broadway intersect, said yesterday: \"We are in the early stages of discussion about this with architects and possible developers.

This budget serves the conventional purpose: It is a road map for the course the country will be
