Mario Cuomo of New York shocked child welfare advocates when he vetoed a bill that would require health insurers to include immunizations and routine doctor visits for children under 19 in every family policy. The idea was to get more children to doctors before they become seriously ill and before they run up huge health care costs.    Mr. Cuomo liked the idea but not the bill, which he found too costly for ratepayers and technically flawed. He's right on both counts. But what the Governor didn't say was that his staff helped create the problem by failing to work with the sponsors before the bill was passed to clean up the language and lower the costs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930812","headline":"Jury Acquits Mavs' Jackson of All Charges","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/12/sports/sports-people-basketball-jury-acquits-mavs-jackson-of-all-charges.html","abstract":"  A jury in Columbus, Ohio, yesterday found Dallas Mavericks guard JIM JACKSON not guilty of all charges stemming from a disturbance last Dec. 30 during which four people charged that the former Ohio State star had waved a gun at them as they were driving in Columbus.

World Series had a long day in St. Louis yesterday, with the senior team (16- to 18-year-olds) playing a modified tripleheader and the junior team (13- to 15-year-olds) playing in four different games. Because of rain delays on Tuesday, both teams began the day by completing interrupted games, the juniors beating Kansas City, 9-3, and the seniors beating Kansas City, 4-3. The seniors followed with a 9-5 loss to Los Angeles, giving them a 1-1 record going into last night's game against St. Louis at Busch Stadium. The juniors followed with a 4-3 loss to San Juan and a 9-5 victory over Richmond, giving them a 2-1 record going into a late game against Miami. The first R.B.I.

Germany compiled 279.13 points, beating Australia by 25-hundredths of a point. France was third over all with 247.50 points.

John Marshall and his band of urban astronomers planned beach-chair gatherings at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn and the marshes of Staten Island. The Parks Department decided to assemble skywatchers at sites around New York City. Across the region, people had vowed to wake after midnight, throw open their windows and look up.   Overnight, the annual Perseid meteor shower was supposed to have made such a forceful appearance that even in a city of domineering architecture swathed in artificial light, residents would finally be able to sample the heavens. The usually pallid sky should have been flecked with color, giving it more pizazz than the skyline to which it has long been subservient.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New

The far-reaching series of free events performed in the plazas and parks around Lincoln Center offers an unusually wide spectrum of musical events this weekend. Tonight at 8:15, Mingus Dynasty, the band created in the late 70's to perpetuate the legacy of the jazz composer Charles Mingus, will perform his work at the Damrosch Park Band Shell. In Lincoln Center's North Plaza tomorrow and on Sunday, there will be demonstrations of jazz drumming at 2 P.M. (by Chico Hamilton) and frame drumming at 4:30 P.M. (by Glen Velez and Handance). There will be live music at the Fountain Plaza all afternoon on both days. At 7:30 P.M tomorrow at the Damrosch Park Band Shell, the legendary folk singer and songwriter Pete Seeger will lead a coalition of local choruses in a sing-along concert. At once eloquent and modest, Mr. Seeger, now 75, is still the most convincing spokesman for the sing-along tradition.

Mr. Vidnovic offers riveting renditions of \"If Ever I Would Leave You\" and \"Gigi,\" among other Lerner and Loewe favorites. Although the show's other performers -- Maureen Brennan, Eddie Korbich and Juliet Lambert -- don't inhabit the songs as completely, they are thoroughly professional. The director, Deborah R.

The aroma from sidewalk falafel stands has become an ambient perfume on many midtown Manhattan street corners. And now that hummus and baba gannouj have become as much a part of the local food lexicon as pesto, Middle Eastern restaurants have started to lay out the white tableclothes and bid for their share of Mediterranean aficionados.   It's not easy. Like the best food from all the countries surrounding that mythic sea, eastern Mediterranean cooking is generally simple peasant fare that doesn't lend itself to the stylization and culinary conceit that is synonymous with fine dining in New York. Italian restaurateurs use Milano-style lighting and polished marble to give their dining rooms style. The better Greek restaurants evoke the traveler's Aegean. Middle Eastern restaurateurs, on the other hand, can't lean on wide-scale vacation memories or familiar elements of decor to lure New Yorkers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930813","headline":"King's New Lineup","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/13/sports/sports-people-boxing-king-s-new-lineup.html","abstract":"  DON KING, the promoter long associated with the heavyweight division, moved down in class yesterday in announcing he was embarking on a series designed to find the one, true middleweight king.

As part of a series of concerts featuring musicians commemorating their muses, Mr. Davis will perform a tribute to Thelonious Monk. Mr. Davis was a highly promising young jazz musician who branched out into other forms of compositions and improvisations; it will be a treat to hear him interpreting Monk, and performing his own pieces that pay homage to the master. Performance: Sunday at 3 P.M. Tickets: $6. Horn Improvisations    Art Farmer, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Mr. Farmer's group has been a bedrock of the club scene; his visits here a few times a year show off not only his fluegelhorn improvisations, but well-thought-out bands as well. This band features Jerome Richardson, who was shown by a recent Jimmy Heath's orchestra concert to be a major figure on the saxophone. Shows through Sunday are at 9 and 11 P.M. There is a $15 music charge and a $10 minimum. Piano Grooves    Ahmad Jamal, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, near 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212)255-4037. Mr. Jamal and his trio are working on a sort of structural improvisation that really doesn't have much of a precedent in jazz. Pieces jump around from rhythm to rhythm, groove to groove, key to key. It's thrilling, and musical, and Mr. Jamal's piano playing is always graceful and swinging. Performances: Friday and Saturday at 9:30 P.M., 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M. and Sunday at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M.

It is just down the block from Michael's, the New York branch of Michael McCarty's Santa Monica establishment. The original Madeo is in Forte dei Marmi, the coastal Tuscan town that Bruno Vietina, the owner of the Madeo restaurants in America, and the chefs in New York, Paolo Celeste and Alessandro Cherubini, once called home.   The New York Madeo took over the handsome if somewhat stark terra cotta-colored space previously occupied by Eldorado Petit, a Catalan restaurant from Barcelona, and turned the two rooms into a more traditional setting, done in white with touches of blue. Highlighting a menu of appetizers ($7 to $18), pasta dishes ($14 to $18) and main courses ($18 to $26) are several commendable items grilled over wood, like delectable fresh langoustines and sliced sirloin steak. The pastas and risottos range from satisfying (risotto with porcini) to unusual (veal ravioli in a rich walnut sauce) to pedestrian (linguine with pesto sauce). Several dishes boast perfectly cooked white beans, but excessively hot plates keep some of the food cooking long after it is served.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930813","headline":"Owen Should Stay : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/13/opinion/IHT-owen-should-stay-letters-to-the-editor-90634809643.html","abstract":"Regarding \"The West Is Capitulating and Owen Should Walk Away\" (Opinion, Aug. 11) by Jim Hoagland: .Now comes the final chapter in the ethnic genocide in Yugoslavia, the collapse of Sarajevo.

Is it possible that the problem is not the festival's presentation of Mozartean influence, but Mozart himself? Over the past two centuries, composers have repeatedly longed to duplicate the boy wonder's pristine musical world, and their homages have repeatedly fallen short. Mozart is an intangible idol, an impractical ideal; music influenced by him often has a squishy surface, like a nose pressed against a candy shop window.    Those who were around while the young god trod the earth, Haydn and Beethoven in particular, took more useful lessons than the likes of Tchaikovsky and Strauss, who worshiped at a distance. Haydn is the final exhibit in Mostly Mozart's series, and he ought to have been the first; the Mozart-plus-Haydn orchestral program on Tuesday night made eminent good sense. Relations were easily found: the dramatic unison at the outset of Haydn's Symphony No. 93 brought to mind \"Don Giovanni,\" and the Menuetto of Mozart's \"Linz\" Symphony sounded like Haydn through and through.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930813","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/13/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Sir Nigel Broomfield, the British ambassador in Bonn, is reading \"Preparing for the Twenty-First Century\" by Paul Kennedy. .\"This book reminds us that there are some enormous and inescapable challenges already pressing on us which we igno","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930813","headline":"Owen Should Stay : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/13/opinion/IHT-owen-should-stay-letters-to-the-editor-93859759282.html","abstract":"Regarding \"The West Is Capitulating and Owen Should Walk Away\" (Opinion, Aug. 11) by Jim Hoagland: .The assumption of Western policymakers has been that the Serbs were willing to negotiate.

By week's end he had painted a vivid picture: that of a Mayor who is out of touch or often out on tennis courts, disengaged from the details of running the nation's largest city and prone to giving unwavering support to inefficient subordinates at badly managed agencies. Mayor David N.

The Odds and the Woodies, two bands on a triple bill at the Grand on Wednesday night, happily look back to the Beatles, a band whose style is so regularly revived -- by the Raspberries in the early 1970's and Squeeze well into the 1980's, among many others -- that it's easy to forget how many different strands of music the Beatles pulled together and twisted. The trick is to recapture the relative innocence of the mid-1960's without sounding too naive or self-conscious.    Both the Odds and the Woodies write melodic, generally midtempo pop songs with unexpected chromatic twists and carefully placed bits of vocal harmony. But the Odds, from Vancouver, are far less archival. Drawing on Squeeze as much as on the Beatles, the band plays concise arrangements, often with bass, drums and guitar in crisp unison, their low-slung chords making plenty of room for the vocals. From both Squeeze and the Beatles, the Odds learned to match genial melodies to slightly barbed lyrics.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930813","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/13/nyregion/c-corrections-314393.html","abstract":"  A headline on Wednesday about a Florida teen-ager's civil suit against her biological parents characterized the case incorrectly.

You want to sail beneath her strange, stern gaze, admire the folds of her gown, shiver at the deadly sharp points of her crown.    The Statue of Liberty is the star attraction of New York City sightseeing cruises. Sure, there is plenty more to see on a three-hour or a 90-minute trip in the harbor or around the island.

Early in 1960, Hank Ballard and the Midnighters scored a sizable hit with \"The Twist,\" a record that had been the B-side of a minor hit he had released the previous year.

Daily sailings every hour from 9:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. (except 12:30 P.M.) and at 7 P.M. with additional cruises on Saturdays and Sundays. Tickets: $18 for all cruises ($9 for children under 12).     COMPANY MOTTO:\"America's Favorite Boat Ride.\"   BOAT: Each red, green and white member of the fleet is named Circle Line followed by a Roman numeral.   OVERALL EXPERIENCE: It's hard to argue with the motto: this is the archetypal sightseeing experience, with all the pluses and minuses that entails. Circle Line is a floating landmark, the Empire State Building of the water, as New York as subway crime, Central Park carriage rides and maniac taxi drivers.    ITINERARY: A three-hour cruise that entirely circles Manhattan Island: south from Pier 83; down along the financial district; past the Statue of Liberty and Governors Island; under the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges; past midtown and the Upper East Side; north through the Harlem River and around the northern tip of the island, and back south under the George Washington Bridge to Pier 83.    DOCK ENVIRONMENT: The pier, situated next to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, has a vaguely institutional feel: all cement and cinder block, with little speakers that look as if they date from the 50's piping in elevator music as you board. Along 12th Avenue, vendors are hustling naive tourists with cheap knock-off T-shirts and assorted unnecessary objects.    BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT: \"Good afternoon, and a beautiful afternoon it is!\"   DECOR: Not too fancy, but not too shabby, either. Two decks with indoor and outdoor seating, a couple of portholes, white plastic chairs that can be moved around, a wooden dance floor area and industrial carpeting that is guaranteed to be strewn with popcorn by the end of the tour.    PASSENGERS: The teeming masses of the world. Dozens of languages are being spoken on all sides, which adds to that New York international and cosmopolitan flavor. Everyone is jumping up and taking pictures; everyone waves at passing ships or landlubbers on the shore. And who can resist a boatful of happy tourists? People always wave back, whether they're shirtless men on speedboats, rich folks on their private yachts, fellow day-trippers on the Liberty Island Ferry or dock workers in tank tops lolling over pier railings.    TOUR GUIDE: A leftover from the 1950's lounge circuit. Wearing white pants, a navy blazer, a white shirt with the collar out and Wallabes, with slicked-back gray hair and a face that was a cross between Anthony Quinn and a Frank Sinatra acolyte, this fellow was truly a relic of another New York. Between hawking guide books (\"It's got over 30 pages and 50 photos, and it's only $3 -- what a bargain!\"), offering statistics (\"27,000 tons of garbage go out from New York City every day\") and enlightening his audience with descriptions of famed architecture (\"The Empire State Building was the last hangout of King Kong -- remember him?\"), he tossed off a series of jokes that were probably already familiar in the vaudeville era. At one point, he even invoked the grandaddy of painful punsters: \"Henny Youngman once said, 'I knew a girl who had so much bridge work, to kiss her you had to pay a toll.' \" Sometimes he would go off on inexplicable tangents; you'd tune out for a second, looking at the Woolworth Building, and suddenly he'd be giving the ages of George Burns and Bob Hope. \"Guess getting older's not too bad, when you consider the alternative,\" he mused. He listed some famous people who died at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (Andy Warhol, Yul Brynner). Then things took a further metaphysical turn. \"In the next 8 or 10 years there's going to be a dramatic change in the world's weather,\" he said somewhere near Inwood. \"You'll see. You youngsters who are young now, I feel sorry for you.\" He also does birthday and anniversary announcements. During the intermission, women swarmed around him, begging for dedications. Forget the United Nations building: this guy alone is worth the price of admission. Like the Circle Line itself, he's a New York classic.    CREW: They also seem to be aspiring entertainers. One twinkle-eyed, lean young fellow looked at me askance when I asked for a receipt at the lunch counter. He wrote one out and handed it over. \"I signed it Drake Quack,\" he said proudly. \"He wants to be famous,\" explained a female co-worker. Now he is.    HIGHLIGHTS: The Statue of Liberty: it is impossible not to be awed and moved by her splendor. She seems to turn her head and gaze at you as you sail past, dignified and fraught with an elusive, Mona Lisa-like melancholy. \"The greatest lady in the land,\" said the announcer. \"Except for my wife.\"    LOW POINTS: Somewhere after the Williamsburg Bridge, a strange, heavy lull begins to set in. Face it, there's not much to look at on the east side except a lot of hospitals, housing projects and Con Ed plants on the Manhattan side, and burned-out warehouses and wharfs in Brooklyn and the Bronx. People started to conk out. They were lying back in their chairs with their legs stuck out and their mouths open, as if they were home in their easy chairs in front of a ball game. Even the announcer began to lose steam and mumble a lot. He seemed to be desperate for landmarks. \"On the right here we have piles of salt!\" he said with forced enthusiasm.    MOST ARCANE TIDBIT OF INFORMATION: There is enough wire in the cables of the George Washington Bridge to go around the world four times. Runner-up: Did you know that Dean Martin was going to be a lawyer, but he couldn't pass the bar?   FOOD: Tasty hot dogs (mmmm-mmmm), soft-serve ice cream, marble pound cake, Budweiser on draft.    PHOTO OP: A photographer takes pictures of every party that boards; the glossy prints are for sale ($10 each) after you debark.   HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LEAVE: After three hours, you can't wait to get off the thing. But you are, nevertheless, sated and gladdened by this quintessential New York experience.  World Yacht    Leaving from Pier 81, Hudson River and 41st Street, Manhattan, (212) 630-8100. Daily dinner cruises from 7 to 10 P.M., boarding at 6 P.M., Sundays through Thursdays, $62; Fridays and Saturdays, $69.50.     COMPANY MOTTO: \"Elegant Dining Afloat.\" The bizarre grammatical structure of this statement somehow manages to conjure the image of a plate of food bobbing in a bathtub.   BOAT: Duchess of New York, a three-tiered yacht with two large, enclosed dining area, a lower outside deck with cocktail tables and chairs, and a roomy, open upper deck with patio chairs that you can pull right up to the railing.    OVERALL EXPERIENCE: The Love Boat of sightseeing cruises. It's upper-crusty and just a tiny bit snooty, like a semi-fancy dinner party on the water. No jeans are allowed; men must wear jackets. If the television show \"Love Connection\" came to New York, this is where all the contestants would take their dates to impress them.    ITINERARY: A three-hour cruise that heads south from Pier 81 and under the very nose of the Statue of Liberty, timed to happen right at dusk; then up the East Side, turning around after the Manhattan Bridge and coasting back around the lower tip of the island.   DOCK ENVIRONMENT: There's valet parking and lots of wealthy international businessmen wandering around with their coiffed and gowned wives and dates. After the ride, aggressive limousine and town car drivers are hanging around to take advantage of naive or tipsy debarking tourists.    BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT:Very efficient and professional: safety procedures, locations of life jackets.    DECOR: Elegant in a Hyatt ballroom kind of way: the dining areas have large windows to allow for spectacular views, the tablecloths are crisp and white, the drinks come with swizzle sticks. Faux Art Deco lighting fixtures give a soft, peachy glow. A jazz trio, switching off with a singing pianist playing pop standards, is set up in front of a dance floor in the lower dining area.   PASSENGERS: A Whitney Houston lookalike in a floor-length royal blue velvet halter gown; tons of dark suits; a middle-aged woman wearing Roman-style sandals with multi-colored laces that wound halfway up her calves. Couples on birthday dates made up no fewer than three tables in my vicinity, and there were clusters of young people celebrating heaven knows what. Champagne corks pop, and the dining rooms eventually build to a boistrous din.   TOUR GUIDE: Don't be gauche. The only time an announcer comes on is to inform passengers that the Statue of Liberty is approaching on the starboard side. Like, thanks. I mean, it's kind of hard to miss. Then the piano player sings \"America the Beautiful\" and \"God Bless America\" really loud.   CREW: The waiters and waitresses are pleasant, though with a tendency to be overly solicitous.   HIGHLIGHTS: The sunset, and the lighting of Manhattan. As you sail up the East River, the evening wans into pale twilight; by the time you've turned around and headed back south again, the lights on the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges have come on, and all of downtown has begun to glow pink and gold. The Statue of Liberty shone against a sky burnt and streaked with fiery red, orange and violet; the harbor was like spilled red paint. Throughout the cruise, passengers are allowed to roam at will; you can pull up a chair, prop your feet on a railing and sink back in bliss in the hot summer night. Faintly now, a song comes through the sound system, a romantic lyric from a gorgeous old standard like \"At Last\": \"My heart was wrapped up in clover/The night I looked at you.\" This is the brilliance of the World Yacht: it allows you to buy a temporary ticket to the privileged class.   LOW POINTS: After coffee and dessert are served, the band kicks into 60's and 70's frat party standards, like \"Mustang Sally\" and \"Takin' Care of Business.\" People get loud and annoying and start singing along.    MOST ARCANE TIDBIT OF INFORMATION: Two fluffy-haired blondes discussing whether the Twin Towers are really twins.    FOOD: Snacky hors d'oeuvres adorn each table when you board. Appetizers include goat cheese salad and seafood pastry; entrees include a Fulton Fish Market selection of the day. And for dessert, the chocolate and raspberry layer cake rules.   PHOTO OP: Same deal as the Circle Line: a photographer takes pictures of your party as you board, then a hostess brings the picture to your table and you are given the option of buying it for $10 each.    HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LEAVE: Quite fulfilled, but glad to get away from that frat party before it gets any more out of hand.  Seaport Circle Line    Leaving from Pier 16, South Street Seaport, lower Manhattan, (212) 563-3200. Daily sightseeing cruises at 11 A.M. and 1, 3 and 5 P.M. Tickets: $12 each ($11 for the elderly; $10 for students; $6 for children 2 to 12).     COMPANY MOTTO: \"America's Favorite Boat Ride.\" The sequel   BOAT: There's a reason the boats are distinguished only by Roman numerals: they're all alike.    OVERALL EXPERIENCE: The Circle Line just recently took over the South Street Seaport cruise, so the general situation is much the same. The major difference is that this ride is only 90 minutes, which fortuitously cuts out that borderline tedious stretch of upper Manhattan.   ITINERARY: From Pier 16 the boat heads south, then west around the lower tip of Manhattan, sailing north on the Hudson about as far as Greenwich Village; then it turns around, and does the Statue of Liberty thing. Then it's back up the East River to just below the Empire State Building before returning to South Street.   DOCK ENVIRONMENT: Pier 17, an indoor mall with shops and restaurants, is right next door; the lightship Ambrose and the schooner Pioneer are docked nearby.    BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT: \"We're going to ask you to help us out here. Please don't throw anything overboard.\"   DECOR: Same plastic white chairs, same concession stand with food and souvenir goodies, same industrial carpeting with popcorn spilled on it.   PASSENGERS: A bit more low-key and easy-going than those on the regular Circle Line. You kind of get the feeling they came to South Street Seaport to shop and buzz around, and then happened to see the sign for the cruise. Because it's only 90 minutes, it's much less of a commitment.   TOUR GUIDE: Much more restrained than his uptown counterpart, although he seems to date from the same era: he has a 1950's television announcer vibe to him, earnest and deadpan and slightly nerdy.   CREW: They don't want to be famous, they're just doing their job.   HIGHLIGHTS: You just can't see the Statue of Liberty too many times.    LOW POINTS: Like the other Circle Line announcer, this guide seemed to be slightly at war with the modern world. When the Staten Island Ferry went by, he couldn't help remarking: \"For years the ferry was 5 cents. Gone up like everything else. It's now 50 cents.\" Like that's a rip-off. Hey, buddy, your boat costs 12 smackeroos.    MOST ARCANE TIDBIT OF INFORMATION: The sculptor Bartoli fashioned the face of the Statue of Liberty after his father's.    FOOD: There's a reason everybody's buying that popcorn: it's darn good. Freshly popped on board, and all hot and buttery.   PHOTO OP: No, but disposable cameras are for sale at the concession stand.    HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LEAVE: Sunlit and invigorated.  Port Imperial Harbor Cruise    Leaving from Port Imperial, Weehawken, N.J., (800) 533-3779. Sailings Mondays through Sundays at 10:30 A.M., 1:30 and 4 P.M. Tickets: $12 for adults, $6 for children. (Tours also leave from the line's Manhattan terminal on West 38th Street.)     COMPANY MOTTO: Doesn't have one yet, and somehow \"New Jersey's Favorite Boat Ride\" doesn't do it justice.   BOAT: Robert Fulton, a 97-foot ferry that is smaller than its big-city counterparts.   OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Really fantastic. The Port Imperial cruise hits the perfect balance of history, education, human interest and fun. Since it's fairly new, it isn't overrun with crowds: you can sit wherever you want and move around to other seats in enclosed or open-air sections.   ITINERARY: A 90-minute ride that leaves Weehawken and then picks up passengers from Port Imperial's Manhattan terminal before sailing back down the New Jersey side, closely hugging the shore to allow a great view of landmarks like Ellis Island and the gorgeous railway terminals in Hoboken and Liberty State Park; south around Governors Island and past the Statue of Liberty; up the east side along the Brooklyn shore as far as the Brooklyn Bridge, and back south and around lower Manhattan.   DOCK ENVIRONMENT: Beautifully landscaped and meticulously tended on both the Jersey and New York sides, with bursts of marigolds and flowering trees.    BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT: Well, there are still a few kinks in the system. The public address system wasn't working properly at first. An energetic woman in flowing brown pants and a print shirt, with red combs and blue bows in her graying hair, jumped out and explained the route without amplification. She said someone named Dennis was going to fix the P.A., and a swarthy man in the pilot room said, \"Test, test, test,\" and everything was fine.    DECOR: Spic and span white metal benches, plastic zip-open windows. Everything is so clean that if you spill a drop of coffee or lose a napkin, you instinctively pick up after yourself. And the crew tends to the boat as if it were their own home. Not once but twice Dennis was puttering around the deck with a dustpan and broom.    PASSENGERS: Friendly but quiet and attentive. White-haired men in slacks and suspenders, well-behaved children. The only sourpuss was an old fellow in a straw hat who complained to his wife that he was cold and why hadn't she told him to bring his jacket.   TOUR GUIDE: After the P.A. was fixed, the energetic woman introduced herself as Wilma. She related details about the architecture on both sides of the river: the history of the Maxwell House coffee plant in Hoboken, the New Jersey shipyards and dock industry. She particularly enjoyed pointing out interesting architectural juxtapositions, and offered idiosyncratic criticisms on the subject. For example, cruising around lower Manhattan, she pointed out side-by-side ferry terminals, one designed in the ornate turn-of-the-century style and currently used by the Coast Guard, and the other in a more modern tile design for the Staten Island Ferry. \"The Staten Island terminal was designed in green to resemble the oxidation of the older terminal,\" she explained. \"I always say that it looks to me like a car wash.\" Furthermore, she shared the most amazing things: that Ellis Island was used as a place to execute pirates, or that excavation from the construction of the New York subway system was used to build up Governors Island. She became quite excited when we encountered a fire boat display off lower Manhattan. \"It's a rare thing to see,\" she said reverently, as the boat sprayed tall, arching streams of water into the air. \"It's the first time I've ever seen it in person.\" Plus she had a sense of humor, and pointed out some nude bathers on a pier in TriBeCa.   CREW: Dennis wins the Sightseeing Cruise Employee of the Month award.   HIGHLIGHTS: Really, this cruise was a pleasure from beginning to end. When we passed the exclusive North Cove in Battery Park, Wilma said drily, \"Perhaps some of you left your yachts here when you came in?\"   LOW POINTS: No complaints here.   MOST ARCANE TIDBIT OF INFORMATION: The Burger King on Governors Island serves beer.    FOOD: O.K., the food left something to be desired: just bags of chips and pretzels, coffee, etc. Give them time.   PHOTO OP: This cruise is hype-free.    HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LEAVE: You are actually, honestly making plans to come back and bring friends. Amid Dennis's cheerful banter and Wilma's edifications, with the sun dancing on the water and the warm summer wind blowing in from the sea, even the sourpuss had to smile.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930813","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/13/nyregion/c-corrections-315193.html","abstract":"  An obituary on Wednesday about a retired public health worker who lived in Cambridge, Mass., gave her name incorrectly.

The babies receive no special treatment for their infections until, months or years later, they develop the first symptoms of their fatal affliction.   How could this happen in a supposedly enlightened community? The answer is not callousness or carelessness. The neglected babies are simply the price knowingly paid for what is perceived as a greater good -- protecting the privacy of the mothers and thus enhancing the likelihood that mothers will voluntarily cooperate with the health system, not only in fighting AIDS but in improving overall family health.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930813","headline":"Romania Offers Dramatic Data on Abortion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/13/opinion/l-romania-offers-dramatic-data-on-abortion-360793.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In the debate on abortion, advocates of choice have often urged that the consequence of making abortion illegal, or legal but inaccessible, will be much higher mortality among pregnant women who feel compelled to seek back-alley abortions.

In her inimitable style, she will recite stories about the African diaspora in performances for the family program of the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival. Ms. Whitney will be joined by Pearls of Wisdom, a group of elder female storytellers who like tales of courage, and who doesn't need to hear about that? They will perform at 3:45 P.M. tomorrow and Sunday.   Families can also try the festival's dance workshops tomorrow and Sunday. At 2 P.M. each day, Silvana Magda's Viva Brazil ensemble will show how to do the samba de roja, the original samba, in which you invite the person next to you to dance by bumping into him or her. (You can't be shy.) They will also teach the samba carioca, which has more hyped-up movements. Greek circular and line dancing reach back to the days of Helen of Troy, and at 3 P.M. the Greek-American Folklore Society will teach the basic 5/4 rhythm that this dancing is about. At 4 P.M. each day, the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers will teach round dancing, and at 5 P.M. you can learn contra dancing.   There's nearly a trainful of other entertainers, including Pete Seeger tomorrow at 7:30 conducting a 200-voice chorus, plus puppeteers and drummers throughout tomorrow and Sunday afternoon, all free. 'Fool Moon'  Richard Rodgers Theater  226 West 46th Street  Manhattan  (212) 307-4100  Recommended ages: 6 and up  Through Sept. 5    At the opening of this high-brow clown show, David Shiner, one of the two performers, climbs over a row of people, practically choking a man in the last seat. That leads to a burst of near-fisticuffs, which Mr. Shiner seems to encourage. He then moves through the audience, throwing people's clothes around while pushing them out of their seats. He's an aggressive clown, with a hatful of neurotic tics and an ability to mock people while making them want more. His partner, Bill Irwin, a clown who has received a MacArthur Fellowship, is a slyly humorous guy who in one act tries to seduce Mr. Shiner's date. In another act, he has infinite trouble putting a vest on; children can relate to that.   In fact, children can find a lot in common with Mr. Shiner and Mr. Irwin's antics. The two-hour show relies a lot on audience participation; during a recent show, a boy and a girl from the audience were enticed onto the stage to participate in an act with Mr. Irwin.   Tickets are available in all sections at most performances. Performances are Monday through Saturday at 8 P.M.; there are matinees on Wednesday and Saturday at 2 P.M. From Aug. 30 to Sept. 5, performances will be Tuesday through Saturday at 8 P.M., Wednesday and Saturday at 2 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M. Tickets are $25, $37.50 and $42.50 except for Friday and Saturday nights, when they are $32.50, $39.50 and $45. 'Girls and Girlhood' 'A Perilous Path'  United Nations Lobby  45th Street and First Avenue  Manhattan  (212) 759-0760  Recommended ages: 7 and up  Through Aug. 19    This small exhibition uses large, handsomely painted illustrations and photographs of girls around the world to show that they are not only different from boys but are also often treated in a petty way, as if they are, indeed, the second sex.   Against this colorful backdrop, which includes illustrations adapted from \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Linnea in Monet's Garden,\" American girls can read facts about girls on the other side of the world. For example, 60 million girls do not have access to primary schools, compared with 40 million boys. In Java, girls work 30 percent more hours per day than boys do. In Bahrain, 50 percent of girls are married by age 15. Visitors may find that the photographs alone -- of street girls, girls selling flowers, a girl washing clothes in a murky river -- tell the story.   The free exhibition, a collaboration between Unicef and children's book authors, illustrators, publishers and photographers, suggests that the remedy is not to ignore the differences between boys and girls, but to identify and end discrimination in health care, play and schooling, and to promote self-esteem and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse. The lobby is open daily from 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930813","time":"1993-08-13
