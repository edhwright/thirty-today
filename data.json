The microorganisms in their severe, invasive form can cause a fatal drop in blood pressure, toxic shock and organ failure and, in about 25 to 50 percent of cases, in a form known as necrotizing fasciitis can eat away at flesh.

It is the Ranger defenseman's way to deal with a playoff tension that has grown for weeks. As New York's fortunes have ebbed and flowed, and now, even as they have come within one game of a Stanley Cup championship, the most dominant player on the ice has struggled to keep his emotions under control.    \"When the opportunity is there, get involved,\" Leetch said, \"but otherwise get it off the boards and get it out of the zone.\"    His mindset is part of a spectacular final stage of his continuing development this season. Leetch's goal and three assists became a powerful enough factor in the 4-2 Ranger victory tonight to all but guarantee that an American-born player will win the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the finals. Spectaular Playoffs    Leetch has scored four goals with five assists in the series. He has 10 goals, with 22 assists, in the playoffs. Leetch's total of 32 playoff points passed Al MacInnis of Calgary to become second to Paul Coffey's record of 47 points in 1985.    But his presence again extended beyond offensive statistics. On an evening when the Ranger defensive unit struggled at times to deal with the sudden strikes of the Vancouver Canucks, Leetch took advantage of enough opportunitites to help change a game, and perhaps a championship series.    \"It's hard to say that his play has improved since the Islander series, but it has,\" said Coach Mike Keenan. \"He started the playoffs playing his best hockey and he has improved it every series from that point on. He has just been an exceptional player for us. He's making things happen offensively. He's playing exceptionally well defensively. He has been able to withstand a tremendous amount of ice time, and he has the stamina and endurance and drive to lead the hockey team.\"    Leetch's 10th goal of the playoffs, at 4 minutes 3 seconds of the second period, presented a reward for Mike Richter's game-saving goaltending. The play ended with Leetch waiting for Joe Kocur to present a problem in front of the net, a technique he explained was developed in part to compensate for the power that was lost because of an injured shoulder.    But the start of the play underlined the unspectacular but essential part of Leetch's game -- a poke check at the Ranger blue line that sent the flow in the opposite direction.    His smooth pass that helped create Aleksel Kovalev's third-period power-play goal, the game-winning score, was part creativity and part necessity. Leetch felt a slash from the stick of Canuck defenseman Brian Glynn, whom he had just passed to create a two-on-one, with Jyrki Lumme the one Canuck back.    \"I didn't think I could get off a good shot there,\" said Leetch, who had his shoulder iced after the game.    So as the two approached the net, seemingly in slow motion, Leetch made himself into a playmaker. \"I tried to make it look like I was going to shoot,\" he said, \"and I just slid it under the guy's stick.\"    When the game was over and the Cup was a game away, Leetch had one more move to make. Mark Messier was behind a desk in an interview area, already dressed in a suit, sitting in the television lights. Leetch was standing to the side, in the wings, in a blue Ranger windbreaker and shorts. His hair was still matted. He studied the floor as Messier spoke. Finally, the Ranger captain heard the question:    \"Mark, you've won a Conn Smythe Trophy. Is Brian Leetch a Conn Smyth winner?\"    Down the hall, in the Ranger dressing room, Leetch's teammates were already reciting how difficult the final step would be. There is a party line to remember. But near the end of Leetch's remarkable spring, with his team one game away, it seemed the exit polls were all closing early.    \"We're not going to fall into that trap,\" Messier said at first. But then, he skated around it. \"Obviously,\" Messier observed, \"His performance, in the last two games, he has been the best we've all seen in a long time.\"    That is still for the others to say. Maybe it will always be that way for Leetch. He was asked what thought appears in his head when he hears the name Conn Smythe. \"That really doesn't matter to me,\" Leetch said. \"I haven't won the cup before. I haven't been to the finals before.\"   He was keeping it simple to the end.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940608","headline":"Mr. Foley, Still Dancing on Reform","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/08/opinion/mr-foley-still-dancing-on-reform.html","abstract":"  \"Your ideas,\" House Speaker Thomas Foley tells grass-roots Democrats in a recent fund-raising letter for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, \"will help us formulate a list of our legislative priorities.\"    Mr. Foley does not, however, care to hear from the grass roots on one pressing issue.

It's easy to hear why he's so popular. At 28, Mr. Coltrane is rapidly acquiring a distinctive voice, with a thoughtfulness that sometimes eludes more experienced musicians.   His set on Tuesday night showed him to be an improviser who, in his reticence, forces a listener to follow him. At first he sounded almost timid. But after a few minutes it became clear his improvisations were loaded with turnbacks, repetitions, asides and afterthoughts, as if he were having a conversation with himself. He broke his solos into fragments, short bursts that were always self-referential and oddly balanced. Where jazz instrumentalists often seek a linear flow, Mr. Coltrane's solos were occasionally still, as if he were building a static monument out of ideas, repeated, examined, turned over, turned sideways and then added to a pile of previously used motifs.   He can burn, too. Backed by Billy Childs on piano, Calvin Jones on bass and Cindy Blackman on drums, Mr. Coltrane, on up-tempo tunes, draped harmony over harmony, compressing dense phrases into small spaces. He has the gift of ease and even ideas that should have been unmanageably dissonant, or pitches that sailed way off the mark, floated back into his schema. Mr. Coltrane hasn't yet figured out how to use dynamics, or articulate all his ideas. And he doesn't have a group conception, at least on the evidence of this one set. But he has promise, intelligence and individuality, which is more than half the battle.

Under the cap, mothers who give birth while on welfare would receive no additional money for the care of the additional child. That will do little good and much harm. According to nearly every careful study, family caps do nothing to discourage childbirth but they do victimize innocent children.   Family caps, which are also included in several bills already before Congress, are based on the false notion that larger benefit checks encourage welfare mothers to have more babies and thereby stay longer on welfare. But a welfare mother would have to be crazy to think of babies as an economic advantage. The average extra stipend to welfare mothers who give birth is less than $75 a month -- which does not even cover the cost of diapers and other expenses for the new baby.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940609","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/nyregion/news-summary-336327.html","abstract":"  International A3-11  JAPAN BALKS AT SANCTIONS  The Clinton Administration's plan to seek new global sanctions against North Korea for its defiance of nuclear inspectors has run into resistance from Japan.

The conditions, by curtain time, were as close to idyllic as one could hope for in the middle of Manhattan. The weather was comfortably cool and breezy. Balloons floated over blankets arrayed with picnic dinners, wine and candles. Pinkening clouds floated over the Carlos Mosely Music Pavilion, and the roar of passing aircraft competed for attention with the strains of Puccini's \"Tosca.\"   By police estimate, about 50,000 people turned up, which is either one-tenth of the audiences at Central Park concerts by Luciano Pavarotti or Paul Simon, or the equivalent of 12.5 full houses at the Met, depending on one's point of view.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940609","headline":"Pool Praised By Governor In Turnabout","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/nyregion/pool-praised-by-governor-in-turnabout.html","abstract":"  Three weeks after he derided a proposed $24 million state-financed aquatic center for the 1998 Goodwill Games as a Taj Mahal, Gov.

If the medium can lay claim to masterpieces, two would have to be the Potter mini-series: \"Pennies From Heaven\" and \"The Singing Detective.\"   Probing themes of reality and illusion, sex and death, public and personal betrayal, Mr. Potter had boundless contempt for timid industry accountants or feel-good critics who refused to acknowledge that television could be as serious and significant as literature or films at their best.

Many of us would like to believe, it seems, that the homeless are homeless largely because they refuse to help themselves. Wouldn't it be easier to pass scores of beggars each day, or read about families sleeping in welfare offices, if we knew that they were there not because of economic forces but because they refused to enroll in a drug treatment or job training program?\n\nThe Mayor's new plan would compel homeless people to sign \"independent living plans\" to \"assist them in resolving their crises and in moving towards independent living.\" Never mind that it is almost impossible to place homeless people in effective drug treatment because there are no available beds -- and that scores of beds in these programs are occupied by people who have completed treatment but cannot leave because they have no housing.

From the beginning to the end of his prodigious career, his intimates -- friends, dealers, children -- figured frequently in his art, and depictions of women, predominantly his wives and mistresses, form its very core. Few artists have invented so many ways to convert the machinations of ego and id into image.    At no time in Picasso's oeuvre was the overlap of life and art more clear-cut, intense or esthetically fruitful than in the tumultuous years of 1927 to 1942. This period saw the bitter failure of his marriage to the Russian dancer Olga Koklova and his passionate but manipulative affairs with successive and competing mistresses: Marie-Therese Walter, who when he met her was a 17-year-old schoolgirl, and the photographer Dora Maar. In addition, Picasso's personal turmoil was heightened by the wanton violence of the Spanish Civil War, which gave him a renewed and anguished awareness of his homeland that culminated in \"Guernica,\" the monumental mural he painted in the spring of 1937 for the Spanish Pavilion of the Paris World's Fair.   Now, for the first time, some of Picasso's most personal works from these years are the subject of their own show. \"Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar,\" organized by Judi Freeman for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, has come to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, albeit in a substantially enlarged and reconfigured form.    By the standards of many Picasso shows, it is rather small -- only 84 works -- but it is nonetheless exciting and revealing. Like most Picasso shows, it has something for everyone, and then some.    For the general public, it has extra amounts of the usual Picasso fireworks: love and passion, anger and catharsis, empathy and despair, spelled out in a series of powerful, often richly worked paintings and drawings. Throughout the show, one can see Picasso's passions wax and wane, as new love generates new painting styles. Olga is reduced to an animalistic abstraction, a hard-edged monster with a jagged screaming mouth; Marie-Therese is a floating dream of lavender curves and post-coital sensuality, the decorative apotheosis of the Surrealist unconscious. The beautiful, intensely intelligent, increasingly distraught Dora Maar inspired an angular style that gives Expressionism a Cubist infrastructure and recalls the vibrant striations of the \"Demoiselles\" period.    Occasionally the main characters meet: in the astounding drawing \"Murder\" of 1934, a fleshy version of Olga's \"screaming head,\" now equipped with giant rotting teeth and pinwheel arms, plunges a butcher knife into a sketchier victim who has the rounded tell-tale profile of Marie-Therese. Needless to say, the implications of biography are so heavy in the air here that one can almost hear screenplays and story treatments chugging out of fax machines all over Hollywood.   For anyone deeply interested in painting, this show is a fascinating exegesis on the medium's ways and means, a series of themes and variations -- and more variations -- based on the female body and face. It is also an invaluable commentary on form following feeling, which highlights Picasso's powers of invention and reinvention. And surreptitiousness: in \"Guitar Hanging on a Wall\" (1927) he covertly acknowledges his new relationship with Marie-Therese by showing her shadowlike profile surveying their linked initials, with hers being arranged to suggest a body with open legs.    There are a few instances of startling ineptness, like the awkward forms and heavy-handed surface of \"Bust of a Woman,\" in which a screaming head appears to bite a black, Malevichian painting. More frequent are moments of blissful beauty: a small painting of Marie-Therese in which her weightless lavender body is dotted with colored circles that may be the most delectable spinning spheres in painting since van Gogh's \"Starry Night.\" And from 1937 and '38, when Picasso was dividing his time between Dora Maar and Marie-Therese, there is a series of images of the latter depicted in the angular style usually reserved for the former.    Best of all are the images that form the core of the show: the drawings and paintings of weeping women that were a byproduct of Picasso's studies for \"Guernica.\" In her essay, Ms. Freeman meticulously delineates the various signs and devices Picasso developed to convey human features under stress. Prominent among these are eyes shaped like teardrops, storm-tossed boats or liquid-spilling saucers; tears that hang from eyes like long nails or narrow cascading waterfalls. Nostrils, ears, tongues, teeth, fingers, fingernails and even handkerchiefs: every detail is manipulated to maximum effect, usually to convey double meanings, always to give the convulsions of grief an almost architectural grandeur and an emotional reality beyond realism.   Finally, for Picasso aficianados, both professional and amateur, this show has inside baseball to die for, most of it hiding in plain sight. As much as Picasso himself, its inadvertent subject is the conflict between the old and the new guard of Picasso scholarship. If one takes the time to read Ms. Freeman's essay and compare it with the works and wall texts in the show, one discovers a substantial discrepancy between her thoughts about Picasso and the thoughts of William S. Lieberman, chairman of the Metropolitan's 20th-century department and a veteran of many Picasso projects and exhibitions, who enlarged and reshaped this show for its Met appearance.   (Mr. Lieberman seems to have other disagreements as well. Picasso's 1923 \"Woman in White,\" displayed just outside the entrance to the exhibition, is listed in its brochure under the heading \"Prologue: Olga Picasso,\" despite a recent article by the art historian William Rubin arguing that the painting is a portrait of the 1920's socialite Sara Murphy.)   It is difficult to assess what Ms. Freeman's show accomplished in its original version, especially since the publication that accompanies the show is more a freestanding book than a catalogue and reproduces about 135 Picassos, of which only 40 were actually shown in Los Angeles. But her essay clearly intends to set Picasso's motif of the weeping woman against a backdrop that extends beyond the confines of love, infidelity and individual personality.    Her thesis, while not entirely new, is that Picasso's images of weeping women were not inspired by the anguish he caused Marie-Therese or Dora Maar, but by his own anguish about the Spanish Civil War and its slaughter of innocent civilians. This approach makes the victimization of women less completely central to Picasso's greatness, and places that greatness in a less isolated, more historical context. (Ms. Freeman also reproduces works made by Julio Gonzalez and Joan Miro for the Spanish Pavilion that involved the motif of women in distress.)   Also implicit in Ms. Freeman's treatment is the possibility that the tragedy of the war, especially after the bombing of Guernica, moved Picasso to create an image of female suffering that was deeper and more sympathetic and humane than the animalistic screaming head of Olga, one that he blended with the features of Dora Maar and Marie-Therese.    Mr. Lieberman has more than doubled the number of works exhibited, often by adding rather conventionally realistic prints or drawings of Picasso's wife and mistresses. Some additions are simply eccentric, if not a bit malicious. He opens the show with \"Woman's Arm,\" a little-known sculpture of a clenched fist that Picasso made in 1951 and, more bizarrely, ends it with a 1962 linocut of Jacqueline Picasso, as if to remind us of the last weeping woman in Picasso's life. More interesting are the additions of two dark paintings of Dora Maar from 1942, in which abstracted animalistic features recall Olga's screaming head and suggest that the humanizing effect that began with the studies for \"Guernica\" did not last.   Mr. Lieberman's additions give us more to look at, but they also tend to soften and blur the show's focus, diminishing the prominence of the weeping-women images and reinstating the more conventional lover-by-lover treatment that Ms. Freeman wants to revise. Still, it's hard to complain too energetically. Together, Ms. Freeman's book and Mr. Lieberman's version of her show form a kind of two-for-one bargain that, in the end, gives everyone more to think about, adding a note of curatorial tension that is not out of place in this dramatic exhibition.    \"Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar\" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, through Sept. 4. It is sponsored by Paine Webber.
