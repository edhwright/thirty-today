At the same time, a new cultural climate is developing and taking hold, which gives crimes against life a new and -- if possible -- even more sinister character, giving rise to further grave concern: broad sectors of public opinion justify certain crimes against life in the name of the rights of individual freedom, and on this basis they claim not only exemption from punishment, but even authorization by the state so that these things can be done with total freedom and indeed with the free assistance of health care systems.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/nyregion/no-headline-707795.html","abstract":"  \"The coach gave us the  answer key last year.

His current exhibition at PaceWildenstein on East 57th Street is his best in several years. For a while, it seemed that Mr. Shapiro, one of several talented Post-Minimalist sculptors who emerged in the late 1960's and early 70's, was becoming his generation's answer to Henry Moore. He had all but perfected a race of semi-abstract falling figures, built in blocky beams of wood and then cast in bronze, that had proved quite popular; judging from the life style magazines, it often seemed that a Shapiro figure poolside was de rigueur in Hollywood.    Perhaps Mr. Shapiro's recent commission for the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington pushed him to greater depths in his art, or a moment of reassessment. That piece intensified the drama of his staple forms: not only the ambiguously unbalanced figure whose skewed beamlike limbs seemed to signal human catastrophe, but also the abbreviated geometric house shape, which for this occasion was presented precariously on edge. In that work, Mr. Shapiro depicted a world being blown apart with a clarity of form and meaning that can be the mark of a successful -- which is to say, accessible -- public monument.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"Fulton Market Fire Investigators Find Blaze Was Deliberately Set","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/nyregion/fulton-market-fire-investigators-find-blaze-was-deliberately-set.html","abstract":"  Fire Department officials said yesterday that the blaze that destroyed one of the two main commercial buildings at the Fulton Fish Market on Wednesday had been deliberately set.

But while \"Constructing the Self, Constructing America\" is peppered with fascinating insights, the volume is also filled with dogmatic assertions that ultimately color all of the author's arguments. It should not be read as an objective or fair-minded cultural history, but as a highly ideological assessment of American psychotherapy and its social and political implications.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"Complicated Fuel 'Fingerprint' Is a Clue to Formula One Racing's Dispute","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/sports/IHT-complicated-fuel-fingerprint-is-a-clue-to-formula-one-racings.html","abstract":"If Formula One racing has become increasingly predictable - Michael Schumacher wins, or Michael Schumacher is disqualified - what remains arcane are the rules of the International Automobile Federation. .There is the rule about a driver's passing anoth","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"THE MOVIE GUIDE : Les Rendez-Vous de Paris","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/style/IHT-the-movie-guide-les-rendezvous-de-paris.html","abstract":"Directed by Eric Rohmer.

Intelligence Agency that seems to defeat all remedial efforts, starting with the Congressional inquiries 20 years ago into intelligence abuses.

Each day seems to bring a disturbing new disclosure in these cases. First Representative Robert Torricelli reported that a Guatemalan colonel on the C.I.A. payroll as an informant ordered the killing of Michael DeVine, an American living in Guatemala, and Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, a rebel leader married to an American, Jennifer Harbury. Though there is no evidence so far that the agency knew of the killings in advance, it withheld information about them after it learned, impeding the State Department's efforts to determine what had happened to the men.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950401","headline":"Up the River?

Hinckley Jr. opened fire. It was March 30, 1981. Mr. Hinckley, a 25-year-old mentally disturbed gun enthusiast, fired six shots at the Presidential entourage. Mr. Reagan suffered a near-fatal wound to the chest. His press secretary, James S. Brady, was hit above the left eye. Two other men were wounded. It was an old, old story. The insanity of gun violence, a crippling and seemingly incurable American disease, had flared again.   Fourteen years later the National Rifle Association, a fanatical organization that is awash in the blood of homicide and suicide victims, is accelerating its never-ending fight to expand the arsenal of guns in America. Weapons manufacturers in the U.S. are turning out more than 500 guns an hour, but the N.R.A. and its political henchmen are not satisfied. With the leadership of the Republican Party in its pocket, the N.R.A. is fighting for the repeal of virtually all existing gun control laws, including the ban on assault weapons.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950401","headline":"Chicken Pox Vaccine Offered Many Challenges","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/01/opinion/l-chicken-pox-vaccine-offered-many-challenges-808295.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Delay of Chicken Pox Vaccine Had High Cost\" by Terese Loeb Kreuzer (letter, March 25):","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950401","headline":"Cost to Run 3 Hospitals Is $1.7 Billion a Decade","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/01/nyregion/cost-to-run-3-hospitals-is-1.7-billion-a-decade.html","abstract":"  A long-awaited study of the feasibility of the Giuliani administration's plans to sell three of New York's municipal hospitals says the hospitals are inefficiently run now and would cost the city $1.7 billion to maintain over a decade.

The witness, Sharon-Jo Ramboz, said that years earlier, when she was a teen-ager, she was home alone when an assailant broke into the house, beat her and left her for dead. This time, she said, the rifle saved her life and the lives of her three children, and she supports Republican efforts to repeal a law passed last year banning them. But in the audience was another woman, Byrl Phillips-Taylor, whose 17-year-old son, Scott, was shot six times with an AK-47 fired by an 18-year-old classmate, and she was there to show her support of the assault-weapons ban. DELAYS IN CONGRESS -- A new political skirmish broke out in the Senate, again delaying a vote on midyear budget cuts and prompting the majority leader, Senator Bob Dole, to threaten political war against the White House. \"We're not bringing up any more bills that the White House wants until we have some understanding on the legislation that we thought would go through here in a normal way,\" Mr. Dole said, suggesting that President Clinton was orchestrating Democratic efforts to slow work in the Senate. Mr. Clinton responded by chiding Mr. Dole for not having approved millions of dollars in emergency spending to cover the costs of military operations in Haiti, Somalia and elsewhere. But any hope of a quick vote on that bill or the separate midyear budget cuts was further dimmed by a partisan fight over taxation of multimillionaires. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, vowed to tie up debate in the Senate unless it first considered his proposal to close a loophole that has allowed a handful of multimillionaires to renounce their United States citizenship to avoid taxes. Mr. Dole moved immediately to try to crush the threatened filibuster by filing for a cloture vote on Monday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950401","headline":"Germans' Longtime Love Affair With Bonds Is Cooling Off","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/01/your-money/IHT-germans-longtime-love-affair-with-bonds-is-cooling-off.html","abstract":"Germans have long championed the income-investing cause, piling billions into bonds and bond funds while coolly disdaining equity investments that might return hefty capital gains — but also the occasional loss of principal.

In 1955, the Bums finally avenged five defeats at the hands of their rivals from the Bronx. Stewart Wolpin's BUMS NO MORE! The Championship Season of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers (Harkavy/St. Martin's, $25) is an affectionate salute to that season of redemption. Pitch-by-pitch accounts of the seven games and dramatic photographs of key plays are the next best thing to a box seat in Ebbets Field or Yankee Stadium. As Mr. Wolpin, a former sportswriter at The Newark Star-Ledger, recounts, the Yankee dominance was such that even oddsmakers in Brooklyn bet against the Dodgers. When the Yankees won the first two games, it looked as if the bookies were right. But the Dodgers won the next three, and after another Yankees victory, ended a 55-year championship drought behind the fielding of Sandy Amoros and the pitching of Johnny Podres. Some of baseball's brightest legends feature in Mr. Wolpin's account, from Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider to Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra and Whitey Ford. But he also vividly evokes life in Brooklyn in the mid-1950's and the euphoria that gripped the borough when next year finally arrived. \nHANNA RUBIN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"Seles Is a Surprise Guest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/sports/sports-people-tennis-seles-is-a-surprise-guest.html","abstract":"  MONICA SELES, out of tennis since being stabbed during a match in April 1993, made a surprise appearance yesterday for the dedication of a $3 million indoor tennis center at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va.

A year ago, four teams of architects, designers and engineers were invited by a BBC-sponsored television producer to come up with ideas for remodeling a decommissioned nuclear power plant in northern Wales, to be featured on a documentary series. For one of the firms, the New York design group Site, the invitation launched an epic voyage through time and space that led from Stone Age Britain to the end of the world. It also led the group into the moral quandary that often confronts architects who try to take an active role in addressing social issues.   Trawsfynydd (pronounced Traus-VEN-ith) Nuclear Power Station is a landmark of the atomic age. When completed in 1959, the plant's stark design, by the distinguished architect Sir Basil Spence, was regarded as a suitably awesome symbol of technological power. Today, after decades of increasing public awareness of ecological issues, a visitor is more likely to see the 20-story plant as a monstrous intruder in an Arcadian setting. But in the postwar years many were eager to regard the plant and its lush green surroundings as a natural fit. Nuclear power, so the reasoning went, tapped into the innermost mysteries of nature. Why couldn't it coexist harmoniously with forests and lakes?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"ART;\nJacob Lawrence Applies His Geometry to John Brown's Story","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/nyregion/art-jacob-lawrence-applies-his-geometry-to-john-browns-story.html","abstract":"THESE are triumphant times for Jacob Lawrence.

Begun in the 1940's by the former New York Timesman Red Smith, the original group of diners included fly-fishing pioneer Lee Wulff and A. J. McClane, who was perhaps the greatest American angling author of all time -- if you don't count Ernest Hemingway. Over the years the dinner party grew, taking over all of the tables in the Antrim Inn, a wonderful Catskills roadhouse that went out of business a few years ago.    The party and the trout have since moved to the nearby Rockland House and yes, the trout does have two heads, but savvy anglers have long suspected a taxidermist's subterfuge.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"On Helping Patients Who Lose Their Way","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/nyregion/l-on-helping-patients-who-lose-their-way-036295.html","abstract":"  Re the Connecticut Q&A with the Rev.

Commissioner William J. Bratton and three of his predecessors, Patrick V. Murphy, Benjamin Ward and Richard J. Condon, spoke at New York Law School on Friday about how best to fight the perennial problem. They discussed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's battle with the City Council over having an independent monitor oversee the force, what kind of monitor is most effective, how its members should be chosen and whether it should have subpoena powers. The discussion, part of a daylong seminar, drew on experience dating to the days of the Knapp Commission and before. GEORGE JAMES Commissioner Benjamin Ward, who wants to make commanders at the precinct level more accountable by giving them more power to fight corruption.   \"When you ask the Mayor to be totally responsible, you either have to have this very naive Mayor that we have today, if he is, or someone that just thinks he can conquer all and is willing to take on the kind of pressure that will come to him if his commission fails to control corruption. Because what is he going to investigate? What is Nick Scoppetta  [ the head of the Mayor's oversight committee ]  and his committee going to be looking at?    They're going to be looking at Bill Bratton and  [ Internal Affairs Chief Patrick ]  Kelleher's attempts to control and suppress corruption. When they find it, who's going to be sitting in the driver's seat, when they find it? His police commissioner, Bratton. How did it start? How long was it going on before Bratton learned about it? Where did he learn about it? Did he find out about it from some Suffolk County policeman who stumbled accidentially on some city cop engaged in corruption, and so when the arrest comes down, it makes the New York City Police Department look inept and in competent because they didn't find it themselves and it was found in East Cupcake and not in the big city?    And is the Mayor going to be up there in the Blue Room saying, \"I picked Bratton,\" as Koch said the other day when he criticized Giuliani, said, 'You want praise? Stand next to Ben Ward and say, 'I picked Ben Ward.' Well, is he going to stand next to Bratton and say, 'I picked Bratton and this is what happened?' Because Bratton can't control all the corruption that occurs in the city.\"  Patrick V. Murphy, commissioner from 1970 to 1973, who replaced 90 percent of the top officers in the department and incorporated many Knapp Commission recommendations, including creating a central internal affairs division.   \"Rather than looking at the culture of the police department, look at the culture of the executive corps . . . . They are critical, and they can make things happen. I am convinced they can prevent corruption if the comissioner holds them accountable and they have the means.\" Richard J. Condon, commissioner from 1989 to 1990, who approves of an outside monitor, be it a special prosecutor like the one appointed following the Knapp Commission, or a strong external investigative body, as was recommended by the Mollen Commission.   \"If you have someone whose sole focus is on corruption, you should be more successful in ferreting out that corruption. And I think however the Mayor and the Council resolve the independent commission, however it turns out, I think that it will be very helpful for the Police Department.\"  Commissioner William J. Bratton, who wants to make commanders at the precinct level more accountable by giving them more power to fight corruption.   \"Information is also now in the process of being shared extensively with the precinct commanders. Why? to get them into the game. To include them. To empower them. To get them into the game. This is being done at great risk, because it's common wisdom -- traditional wisdom relating to internal affairs corruption issues is the fewer people in the know the better, because you might lose a case.   Well, that exclusion type of activity certainly doesn't seem to have worked in the sense that we have in 20-year cycles, whether we had a three-oh type of precinct situation or other precincts like the three-oh . . . .   And I think the time has come to try something different. I think it's radically different, something that is risky. I believe it's worked in dealing with crime. I believe it will work in dealing with the issue of corruption. Time will tell. Will I lose a few cases because somebody has a loose lip? Possibly. But will I win a lot more?    Will you as citizens in New York win a lot more? I think so. What will you win? By having those precinct commanders coming into the game, by giving them authority to deal with this, we can begin to deal with the new insidious type of corruption.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"ON THE TOWNS: MUSIC;\nMelancholy Tribute To a Missing Guest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/nyregion/on-the-towns-music-melancholy-tribute-to-a-missing-guest.html","abstract":"SYMPHONY concerts call for high-road cultural reporting; disaster is hard news.

In Berlin during the first half of this century, the Adlon Hotel was a swirl of romance and intrigue, the place where the most glamorous parties were held and where the most important and exciting people stayed.

Few know the Edwardian ballads that made her a 1960's star in her own right, even her famous but seldom-heard version of the Jagger-Richards tune \"As Tears Go By.\" When she re-emerged in the late 1970's with the stunning, punk-influenced album \"Broken English\" -- and a new voice, bereft of sweetness, bred in basement bars instead of fairy castles -- critics raved but seemed as fascinated with her drug problems as with her artistry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"A Sense of Loss","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/sports/l-a-sense-of-loss-735995.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   Has a dream, a momentum, a raison d'etre been sacrificed along with J.

Perched atop a steep hill that rises from the Vltava River, seemingly impervious to the hordes of tourists gawking from the Charles Bridge below, the fortress was the first of my many encounters with the Czech Republic's regal past, and I did not have to go far to find more.\n\nAfter renting a somewhat rickety Skoda, the Czech-made auto, for $40 for two days, my friend and I drove south from the city last spring and, within 25 minutes, puttered into the lush Berounka River Valley, where Karlstejn Castle loomed on the horizon.

The city government, under the leadership of Mayor Vincent Suozzi, opted instead to build a co-disposal plant at a cost of about $40 million. In the co-disposal design, the incinerator burns the residue from the sewage-treatment system, supplying electricity in the process. If the incinerator does not operate, the sewage-treatment plant still remains.

Last year, for example, the agency prepared a Federal application that led to a $4 million grant for AIDS care on Long Island, which it had identified as the suburban region with the highest rate of H.I.V.  infection in the nation, with an unusually high proportion of cases among women.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"New Outlet Centers Plan Major Expansions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/nyregion/new-outlet-centers-plan-major-expansions.html","abstract":"PLANS to expand the Bellport Outlet Center threefold in a year and to double the Tanger Factory Outlet in Riverhead are producing outrage from some merchants in the region and praise from others.\n\n\"You're creating a shopping island out here and hurting local business districts,\" the president of the Southampton Chamber of Commerce, Thomas F.

Williams took the reins of the Los Angeles Police Department two years ago, friends and foes have agreed on one thing: he is no Daryl Gates.   That was among his prime qualifications for the job, and, paradoxically, it is proving among the greatest obstacles to his success.   Nowhere have the differences between Mr. Williams and Mr. Gates, whom he succeeded as Chief, been projected more starkly than in their respective postures in two racially charged cases: Mr. Gates's ferocious defense of his department in the case of Rodney G. King, the black motorist beaten by white officers, and Mr. Williams's more measured -- and what some see as belated -- defense of the department's handling of evidence in the O. J. Simpson murder case.   The larger-than-life Mr. Gates, Chief of Police for 14 years, was an intense, hands-on leader, an implacable foe of crime. He was also unpredictable and abrasive, his style ultimately deemed out of synch with a highly diverse city where police work is often equal parts criminology and sociology.   He was forced from his job by the beating of Mr. King and his department's ineffective response to rioting that erupted when four officers charged in that beating were acquitted in state court.    Mr. Williams, then the Police Chief in Philadelphia, was recruited as the would-be savior of the Los Angeles force. His supporters described him as compassionate, articulate and an energetic supporter of initiatives like community policing.    Once hired, the new Chief immediately vowed to end what he called the \"paramilitary mentality\" of the department.    Yet the very traits that seemed so appealing in the wake of Mr. Gates's often divisive tenure have brought the 51-year-old Mr. Williams conflict with other police brass, resentment from the rank and file, and concern among the city's business and political leaders, some of whom see the department as once again lacking direction. Now, with three years left on his contract, he is already struggling to keep his job.    Some call him aloof, distant and indifferent to gritty details whose mastery is essential to management of a large organization; others say that although he continues to enjoy broad support among community groups, he has failed to build constituencies and alliances within the police force and among elected officials.    \"There's no doubt that Willie Williams is in deep trouble with the rank and file,\" said Gary Fullerton, director of the Los Angeles Police Protection League, the leading union of the city's officers. \"He's a nice guy, but people just don't see him as a leader.  He's looked upon by the officers as being more concerned with the public than with his subordinates. And he's definitely not a detail-oriented person.\"   Stephen Yagman, a civil rights lawyer who specializes in police misconduct cases, said, \"The only positive thing about him is that he is not Daryl Gates.\" Mr. Yagman, initially a strong Williams supporter, added: \"He has no dynamism, no zest, no verve, no panache. He seems like a nice guy, but he's simply not up to the job.\"   And Mr. Gates, who was long silent about his successor's performance, has in recent weeks become one of the leading critics.    \"Morale is in terrible shape,\" Mr. Gates said in an interview. \"They are losing people left and right. It used to be that the L.A.P.D. was the department that everyone wanted to go to. Now they're leaving, and he's a principal reason.\"   In addition, there are ethical questions.   Last month the Police Commission, the civilian body that oversees the department, undertook an investigation into reports that Mr. Williams and his family had used for private purposes cars, drivers and cellular phones paid for by the public and that he had improperly solicited perquisites that included free rooms at casino hotels in Las Vegas, whose longtime popular perception as a haven for underworld investors has only added to the concern surrounding the reports.   The accusations first surfaced in December, when Stephen Downing, a retired deputy chief, citing what he called widespread rumors of misconduct by Mr. Williams, wrote a letter advising the commission that they \"should be investigated and put to bed one way or the other.\"   Chief Williams, who declined repeated requests for an interview, has said only that he did nothing wrong, and the Police Commission so far has found no wrongdoing. But its formal inquiry into what its president, Enrique Hernandez Jr., calls \"serious charges\" continues.   Many rank-and-file officers, and even some of the Chief's supporters, complain that he has compounded his problems by his choice of a lawyer to represent him in the investigation: Melanie Lomax, who was the Police Commission's acting president when she played a leading role in forcing Mr. Gates from office.   \"For the Chief to choose her as his representative was peculiar, to say the least,\" said Mr. Fullerton, the director of the Police Protection League, \"because the vast majority of officers have traditionally seen her as an enemy of the Police Department.\"    Mr. Gates called his successor's hiring of Ms. Lomax \"another bit of absolute total stupidity on his part.\"   Mr. Williams's supporters, noting that Los Angeles brought in to run its Police Department not only an outsider but a black outsider at that, describe much of the criticism as inevitable.   \"There is no way the first black Chief of Police is not going to have trouble, especially because there is a racist element that remains in the department,\" Ms. Lomax, who is black, said in an interview. \"All of Gates's loyalists are still there, and the chief command staff is still there. They will never forgive Williams for being an outsider.\"   At the Oscar Joel Bryant Foundation, the largest union of the department's black officers, the president, Sgt. Leonard Ross, agreed that race was a major factor in some of the criticism.   \"Before he was ever sworn in, he was being criticized,\" Sergeant Ross said. \"He was never given an opportunity to demonstrate ability or style; the critics met him at the door. There are two reasons for this: one, because he's from the outside, and two, because he was black.\"   Sergeant Ross added that Mr. Williams's \"public support is as strong as ever.\"   Laura Chick, a white City Councilwoman, agreed that support for Mr. Williams among the general public was strong. \"He has rebuilt the public trust and confidence,\" she said, \"and is very much on his way to rebuilding a positive rapport and the kind of support that a law-enforcement agency has to have.\"    Even so, what the critics describe as poor political skills have become a liability that has cost him many potential allies in his current struggles.   For one thing, although Mayor Richard J. Riordan has voiced support for Mr. Williams's continuing to head the department, that support has been lukewarm at best, leading to speculation that the Mayor is backing him mostly to avoid a divisive search for a new Chief.    Mr. Riordan recently appeared at a rally that community leaders had called in support of the job being done by Chief Williams and to urge the Police Commission to conclude its investigation rapidly.    But one of the rally's sponsors, Henry Dotson, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Mr. Riordan's appearance had been just \"for public consumption.\" The Mayor, Mr. Dotson said, \"doesn't wholeheartedly give Chief Williams the support that he really needs.\"    Mr. Riordan declined to be interviewed.    Perhaps most disconcerting to many officers is what they perceive as the Chief's tepid response to the barrage of attacks on the police force during the Simpson trial.   Mr. Simpson's lawyers have argued not only that the police were incompetent in their handling of evidence but also that at least one of their number is a bigot who may have tampered with the crime scene and planted a bloody glove behind Mr. Simpson's house.   Mr. Williams has defended the department's performance and asserted, most forcefully at a public rally last month, that the attacks are merely the hyperbole of a Simpson legal team handsomely paid to cloud the minds of jurors. But his support for his officers has not been nearly enough -- and has come far too late -- to satisfy many of them. For months, the Chief largely refrained from discussing the police performance in the Simpson case, saying that to do so while the trial was still under way would not be proper.    Whereas Mr. Gates was often accused of blindly defending the department, right or wrong, Mr. Williams is perceived by many officers as afraid to offend his supporters, some of whom have long been critics of the police.   Not surprisingly, Mr. Gates agrees with his former subordinates.   \"Everyone knows that I would have defended those police officers,\" Mr. Gates said. As for Mr. Williams's chances of eventually winning the trust of his officers, the former Chief said: \"No matter what he says now, he has lost it. No way he can recover.\"   ","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950402","headline":"ART;\nShowcase for Printmaking Techniques at a New Hostos Gallery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/nyregion/art-showcase-for-printmaking-techniques-at-a-new-hostos-gallery.html","abstract":"HEMINGWAY'S phrase \"a clean, well-lighted place\" is a fine, apt description of the new art gallery at Hostos Community College, which is currently having its second exhibition. \n\nIn the old makeshift gallery, exhibitions were lively and memorable, but the sunlight flooding this cool gray-and-white space is a definite plus.

Many come with traveling cases or special soap dishes that fit the bar's specific shape. 101 MORE USES FOR THE BATH: Designer soaps are part of a larger trend toward more luxurious bath rituals, said Allan G. Mottus, an independent consultant to the cosmetics industry. The bathroom is increasingly being seen as a place to unwind from a stressful day, and homeowners are upgrading bathrooms with additions like Jacuzzis and multihead showers. Bathing or showering two or three times a day has also become more common, especially with the physically and socially active, said Lois Mander, a spokeswoman at Ralph Lauren Fragrances. These groups often bathe once in the morning, again after working out and maybe once more before going out at night. THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING SOAP: Specialty soaps are both simpler and more advanced than \"off the shelf\" soaps. They boast only natural fats and oils, but their formulas also include additives that their manufacturers say distinguish them from lower-priced bars. The Polo Sport soap, for example, contains luffa particles, and the Safari for Men bar has oatmeal, both to help with exfoliation. Calvin Klein's Escape for Men soaps have algae extracts for moisturizing. Glycerine soaps, like those made by Gap Scents, also act as moisturizers. HOW FAT BECOMES SOAP: The ancient Babylonians began making soap around 2800 B.C. by mixing animal and vegetable fats and oils with plant ashes. Today, commercial alkalis have replaced plant ashes, and many \"soaps\" on the drugstore shelves, like Dove, are made mostly of synthetic detergents. SIGNS OF THE TIMES: For label-conscious consumers, stylish soaps are an inexpensive way to indulge, like designer jeans in the 1970's and couture perfumes in the 80's. \"If you can't actually improve your life style, you take ordinary items and give them the aura of aristocracy,\" the sociologist Stuart Ewen said. FOR ONE SEX OR BOTH: Unlike the traditional designer soaps, whose scents have designated them for one sex or the other, the latest ones, like those from Gap Scents and Banana Republic, have gone unisex. Still, few are economical, even if all members of the household can share them. Gap, designer to the masses, prices its soap at $2.50 for 5 ounces, or 50 cents an ounce, while Calvin Klein's Eternity comes in at the high end, at $27.50 for three 3-ounce bars -- more than $3 an ounce. (A 7-ounce bar of Ivory costs around $1.) MAKING THE GRADE: Although they're proliferating, designer soaps make up only 5 to 10 percent of the $1.6 billion soap industry, said Eric Jungermann, a consultant to the soap industry. Antibacterial soaps like Dial, in comparison, make up 35 percent of all soaps sold nationwide. \"Specialty soaps may be high-quality natural soaps with a better finish,\" Mr. Jungermann said, \"but they're not more effective. A good soap is a good soap.\" At a time when flesh-eating bacteria make the cover of news magazines and the recent top-grossing movie \"Outbreak\" is about a highly contagious killer virus, perhaps it's no wonder that the latest product to flex its muscles is soap.

And while the F.B.I. had doubts about Mr. Salem, the agency used him to infiltrate the group of Islamic defendants who, prosecutors say, conspired to wage a war of terrorism against the United States.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"Without Fear or Favor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/books/without-fear-or-favor.html","abstract":"  BEYOND THE DOUBLE BIND Women and Leadership.

The inspiration for the dress actually came to her when she was designing costumes for the film, but American Express would not agree to give her the cards she needed, she said, adding, \"It was a small Australian film, and they really did not want to be involved, and I didn't really blame them.\"    Two weeks before the awards ceremony, when she realized that she needed something to wear, she appealed again to the company, which just happened to be an advertiser for the event, and they agreed to send her 300 cards.

There are three basic types of mats, paper, acid-free museum grade and cotton-rag museum grade. The article points out that corrugated cardboard should not be used as a backing board to mount art work. This is also true of the mat that will be lying on top of the art.   Most conservators would recommend cotton-rag board for both the top mats and backing, since they are inherently pH neutral. However most of the treated boards, acid-free museum grade, have been buffered to resist acids from air pollution and outgassing from other framing materials. The bottom line is that the choice of materials depends on the value of the art work, the esthetics of the presentation and the budget.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"LEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN RECORD NUMBERS WANT CITIZENSHIP","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/us/legal-immigrants-in-record-numbers-want-citizenship.html","abstract":"  The number of legal immigrants applying to become United States citizens has nearly doubled in the last year, an increase that one immigration official described as \"an unprecedented surge\" stemming partly from recent initiatives passed in California and in Congress that would deny many benefits to noncitizens.

Ten days earlier, Wright had released a statement that revealed his condition, announced that he had \"seven children by six different mothers\" and said he wanted his young fans to \"learn about what's real when it comes to AIDS.\" But Wright's career can't be summed up in his cause of death.   Eazy-E, 31, was a classic American figure: a hustler who knew how to surround himself with talent and how to sell sensationalism. He was a member of N.W.A. (Niggaz Wit' Attitude). While he didn't do the bulk of the group's writing or rapping, he was the executive producer of the definitive gangster rap album, N.W.A.'s \"Straight Outta Compton,\" in 1988. With that, he became the entrepreneur who made gangster rap a hot commodity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19950402","time":"1995-04-02
