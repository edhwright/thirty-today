Its Egyptian setting, after all, is a fanciful affectation: apart from the pyramids, which do double duty as Egyptian and Masonic symbols, the work's connections with Egypt are tenuous. The Masonic ritual toward which the tale so elegantly leads is, mythical Egyptophilia notwithstanding, entirely Northern European. And its characters seem almost Alpine. Papageno, for one, may have a connection with the bird-men of Egyptian hieroglyphics, but surely those fierce-looking figures are not meant to be Papageno-like dunces. Indeed, the work's blend of low comedy and high seriousness argues that the setting is the least of the work's concerns.   But for all the leeway this opera offers, directors who update it, transport it or otherwise depart from the traditional staging are few. The production that returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday evening is not among the renegades.

The singer produces a basic note as well as its harmonics, which have a flute- or whistle-like tone.   Tuva, a former Soviet autonomous oblast bordered by Russia and Mongolia, is one of the few places where overtone singing is practiced. Other throat singers, such as the Gyoto Tantric Choir and new-age innovator David Hykes, place the technique in a spiritual context, emphasizing the discipline it requires and its meditative qualities.

Bush. \"Friendly advice,\" Bush says: \"Whatever you do, don't keep a diary.\" Apparently there's nothing prosecutors like more than spending dozens of millions of dollars trying to subpoena diaries. This is the last diary entry I'll ever make. Not that I'm worried about being prosecuted. It's just that diary pages are too small to hold the forty or fifty thousand words I'll need every night to do justice to the events of my day. Albert Gore's Diary   Worried all day about the rain forest burning. Tipper begs me to give it up for the next 24 hours. She thinks it's worrying about all that burning wood that makes me look so wooden when standing beside Bill. Yes, empathy for the death of trees may be showing up in my posture as rigor mortis. After breakfast tomorrow I'll try to worry about global warming. Senator Nunn's Diary   It could be me up there tomorrow except for those popularity polls -- just one short year ago -- showing no earthly human could possibly beat George Bush. Richard Nixon's Diary   Of course I didn't expect Clinton to offer me a front-row seat for the swearing-in. That would be wrong. Should he ask me to head an emergency program to prevent the former Soviet Union from collapsing into a chaos perilous to the entire world, I shall accept it as a great American uniquely qualified for the assignment -- ought to accept it without pointing out that Clinton was not so quick to recognize my stature when invitations to the swearing-in were being handed out.  Marilyn Quayle's Diary   Dan thinks increasingly of being the next President. This morning he asked, if I became First Lady, would I let him invite Murphy Brown to the White House. I asked why in the world he would want to do that. He said he thinks his attack on Murphy Brown cost votes in the last election and believes inviting her to the White House would show he has nothing against her, thus winning over her supporters and helping himself to get elected. I pointed out that if I were the First Lady he would already have been elected, so wouldn't need the Murphy Brown vote. \"Good thinking, Marilyn,\" he told me, as usual. Barbara Bush's Diary   Keeping my eye upon the doughnut and not upon the hole, thank Heaven George will no longer have to prove he's just plain folks by stuffing himself on pork rinds that give him those awful gas pains.  Mario Cuomo's Diary   Sure it could be me up there tomorrow except for those popularity polls showing no human on earth could beat George Bush, in addition to many, many other factors which tempt me to contradict myself and say, No, it could not be me up there tomorrow. Tomorrow! Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace, as Shakespeare observed. But I shall save that for my journal, not throw it away on a flimsy diary. Some think my journal has literary merit, and literature will always outlast the governorship of New York. Its other advantage is that you don't have to go to Albany to do it.  Saddam Hussein's Diary   The hour of glory approaches. The father of evil, the Satan of Satans, the poisonous begetter of mothers of all battles will be forever stripped of his power tomorrow. As I have commanded the author of destiny to write, \"It is writ that when the abominable Bush is struck from power, the rule of Saddam will roll on unbroken upon mighty blasts of heated air.\" Powerful is my prose.

This Requiem hid its origins; it had an organic character, with each movement establishing its own pulse and breath. The performance seemed almost improvised, so natural were its gestures.    Yet behind this performance was a six-day workshop run by Mr. Shaw in which participants from 36 states sang sustained monotones, walked around in circles, counted beats like first-year music students and clapped rhythms. Before the Offertorium could create that other-worldly quality, the singers had to learn to sing without accent but with precise articulation. Before the setting of the \"Salva Me\" text could seem a matter of devout respiration, Mr. Shaw tried conducting three beats to the singers' four -- so they would end up feeling only the pulse of the first. Some early readings focused only on rhythms, sung softly: \"one, and, two, and, tree, and\" (the \"tree\" sound being quicker and more precise than an elongated \"three\").

It may well be that at this point, nearly 56 years after the composer's death, it's only the music that matters. But Gershwin fans interested in peeking behind the scrim erected by the composer's family will have an opportunity to reconsider the composer's life and times in May, when Joan Peyser's biography, \"The Memory of All That: The Life of George Gershwin,\" is due from Simon & Schuster.    The book, like Ms. Peyser's racy 1987 study of Leonard Bernstein, is a psychobiography rather than a musicological study: hints about Gershwin's private and interior life are gleaned from his letters, from his comments as recalled by his associates and from Ira Gershwin's song lyrics, which Ms. Peyser says represent a veiled biography of the composer. Gershwin himself is painted as narcissistic and insensitive, but also insecure and disappointed by his inability to gain a foothold in the \"serious\" music world.  The Unacknowledged Offspring    But there is also a good helping of gossip, and the section of the book that will undoubtedly be most widely talked about is Ms. Peyser's discussion of Alan Gershwin, an impoverished songwriter who was born in 1926, whose original name was Albert Schneider and who grew up convinced that he was the composer's son.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930119","headline":"Rumors of U.S. Superplane Appear Unfounded","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/science/rumors-of-us-superplane-appear-unfounded.html","abstract":"  RUMORS and reported sightings of a secret American superplane have been proliferating lately almost as abundantly as yarns about unidentified flying objects.

With the first phrase of the score, sensitively performed here by Jerry Zimmerman, it was tempting to heed George Balanchine's observation that dancegoers may simply close their eyes and listen to the music at City Ballet. But the spare simplicity of the dance's opening statement of theme, performed with a good mix of lyricism and grandeur by Simone Schumacher and Alexandre Proia, lures one into the ballet's outpouring of group and small-ensemble dances and of carefully joined styles that range from Baroque dance to gentle acrobatics.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930120","headline":"Cuomo Proposes Spartan Budget With Cutbacks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/20/nyregion/cuomo-proposes-spartan-budget-with-cutbacks.html","abstract":"  Gov.

The choir, whose members range in age from 8 to 18, sings material that runs from Duke Ellington standards (\"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" \"Take the 'A' Train\") to \"Byede Mandela,\" by the South African actor and musician Tsepo Mokone, to a choral arrangement of Villa-Lobos's \"Bachianas Brasileiras.\" Wearing sequin-crusted baseball caps, the choir even performs a rap number, \"The Joy of Singing,\" that turns into a pop-gospel anthem.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930120","headline":"Clinton Rounds Out State Dept.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday evening, but surely one of the most inviting was the free concert at Riverside Church, in which Kurt Masur conducted a student orchestra from the Mannes College of Music in a Duke Ellington suite that commemorated Dr. King in its finale. The large interdenominational church was, in fact, an ideal place to remember Dr. King and his message: on April 4, 1967, exactly a year before he was killed, Dr. King gave an antiwar speech there, and it was tempting to imagine him standing at the pulpit.    The concert was an interesting but, from a musical standpoint, only partly successful experiment. It seemed to be the kind of thing Mr. Masur has had in mind since he became the music director of the New York Philharmonic, when he spoke of building bridges between New York and Leipzig (where he directs the Gewandhaus Orchestra) and of taking part in New York's musical life beyond the confines of Avery Fisher Hall.
