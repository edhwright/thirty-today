Like Bill Viola, Ms. Thater uses her medium to immerse the viewer in images of nature, which she pushes toward dizzying, painterly extremes. Thrown up on the wall by three projectors using filters of different colors (red, blue and green), her shifting images of trees and foliage create a disorienting swirl that is never quite in register: a late 20th-century version of Impressionist painting, freed from its frame.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931224","headline":"Castro's Daughter Pleads for Her Own","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/24/us/castro-s-daughter-pleads-for-her-own.html","abstract":"  Fidel Castro's estranged daughter, who defected to the United States on Tuesday after what she described as a cloak-and-dagger escape from Cuba, surfaced here today to tweak her father for his misrule and to plead with him to let his granddaughter join her in freedom.

The bill in question would broaden an existing real estate tax abatement program to cover a swath of midtown and lower Manhattan; the program now covers the rest of Manhattan and other parts of the city. It would freeze real estate taxes on residential buildings for 10 years at rates set before the building was constructed.

It will be hard to find a better party anywhere. The band, whether it's New Year's Eve or not, take the idea of carnival, of excess and celebration, to the limit. They'll play a weird hybrid of country, jazz, blues and rock-and-roll, with the Beach Boys and Sun Ra thrown in for some surrealism. They'll be joined by Terrance Simien and his Mallet Playboys, a rocking Louisiana zydeco band. There are two shows: the first, at 7 P.M., costs $20; the second, at 11 P.M., costs $40 and includes a Champagne toast at midnight. Both shows have a two-drink minimum. PETER WATROUS Rhythm and Reggae    Rosco Gordon, 200 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-2925. The pianist, singer and songwriter, best known for his rhythm-and-blues hits \"No More Doggin' \" and \"Just a Little Bit,\" helped invent reggae in the late 1950's and early 1960's with his off-balance, syncopated sense of rhythm. Then he vanished, only to turn up over the last five years running a dry-cleaning business in Queens. He's a solid rhythm-and-blues performer, and a good pianist who has written some classic songs. He'll be joined by -- and this is a fine idea -- some members of the Skatalites, once Jamaica's finest studio band. The show starts at 11 P.M. There is a $10 cover and a $25 minimum. P. W. Classic Blues    Jimmy Witherspoon, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, near 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 475-0049. One of the last of the great blues shouters will treat an audience to the classic stanzas of the blues. He can have a sweetness to his voice as well, and he's always ready to improvise on jazz standards, all of which will come with a blues nastiness to them. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and at 1 A.M. There is a $25 cover and a $10 minimum. P. W. Zanzibar Guitar    Matt (Guitar) Murphy, Zanzibar, 73 Eighth Avenue, near 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Before this guitarist was saddled with leading the Blues Brothers Band, from the movie of the same name, he was an exceptional blues guitarist who made James Cotton's mid-1970's band rock. He's all speed and texture, and he uses whirling lines that can cause a commotion. There are two sets, at 10:30 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. , and $75 gets you a four-course meal and Champagne, while $35 lets you stand at the bar. P. W. Time-Warped Tunes    Michael White, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. White, a clarinetist, leads what may be the best New Orleans-style band in jazz. It's polyphonic, with tight ensemble parts giving way to the raucous group improvisations that bray and holler. He has become a New Year's tradition at the Vanguard, and hearing his band invites audiences into a time warp; it makes a listener understand why the music so quickly became the popular dance music of its era. There is a $40 cover and a $20 minimum. Sets are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. P. W. Piano Man    John Hicks, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. He's a florid pianist who always plays like he's never going to play again, and wants to get everything he knows in by the last chorus. He'll be backed by the bassist Santi Debriano and the drummer Victor Lewis, who is one of jazz's greatest living drummers. It will be interactive, a three-way musical conversation at its best. The show starts at 9, and for $120 there is a five-course dinner and Champagne. From 1 to 4 A.M., the cover is $20 and there is a $15 minimum. P. W. Two Wily Veterans    Nancy Wilson and Gato Barbieri, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-0049. Ms. Wilson can be a viscerally moving performer, one of the best singers to graduate from Dinah Washington's vocal finishing school. She can be smooth or rough and nasal, and both stances imply emotion. Mr. Barbieri is a showman whose best recordings, made in the 1960's, have a hard power. The 7 P.M. show, for $180, includes a four-course meal and Champagne. At 1 A.M., the $120 tickets include breakfast and Champagne. P. W. Ulmer Power    James Blood Ulmer, Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, East Village, (212) 219-3055. This year is Mr. Ulmer's fifth New Year's Eve at the Knitting Factory, which sounds a bit like a tradition. The guitarist has recorded with everyone from Ornette Coleman to Art Blakey and Joe Henderson. His current music, which makes use of drones and odd tunings, is as distinct as anything that walks the planet. It's hard-rocking, slippery music, charged with power. Sets are at 9 and midnight, and the $20 cover buys a free drink and a Champagne toast. P. W. Dark Side Sounds    Stephen Scott, Down Beat, 70 Grove Street, off Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 620-4000. Mr. Scott is the most austere pianist of his generation, somebody who plays the dark side of every tune. The music comes out moody and emotional. He's anything but glib, and his sense of space is wonderfully Monkish, elegant and relaxed, yet taut. He's a young master. There are three sets, at 9 and 11 P.M. and at 1 A.M. The $35 cover includes two drinks plus Champagne and party favors. P. W. Adderley's Band    Nat Adderley, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. One of the best working bands in jazz features Mr. Adderley's cool sound on horn, and Vincent Herring's explosive soloing on alto and soprano saxophones. The rhythm section includes Rob Bargan on piano, Walter Booker on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums and it swings with authority. It's mainstream jazz at its most exciting. The show starts at 9 P.M. and $99 includes dinner, Champagne and party favors. The late show, which starts at 1 A.M., has a $25 cover and a $25 minimum, and includes a Champagne toast. P. W. Trio at Zinno    Junior Mance and Kirk Lightsey, Zinno, 126 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-5182. Mr. Mance, a bluesy, sophisticated pianist, will open with a solo set at 6 P.M. He'll be followed by a trio led by the pianist Kirk Lightsey and including Cecil McBee on bass and Marcus Belgrave on trumpet. The first show features a dinner, for $25.95. The second show, which starts at 8:30 P.M., costs $80 and includes dinner and Champagne. P. W. Visiones, in the Village    Cecil Brooks 3d, Visiones, 125 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-5576. Mr. Brooks, a good young drummer, always leads swinging bands, and this one includes the trumpeter Jack Walrath and the pianist James Weidman. Jeanie Bryson, a singer, will be on hand as well. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and at 1:30 A.M. The first set has a $12 cover and a $10 minimum; the second, a $25 cover and a $10 minimum, and the 1:30 set has a $10 cover and $10 minimum. For $100, stay for three sets and have a full dinner and Champagne; $65 buys three sets, three drinks and a Champagne toast. P. W. Sharp in SoHo    Elliott Sharp, Nick and Eddie, 203 Spring Street, at Sullivan Street, SoHo, (212) 219-9090. Mr. Sharp, a guitarist and fixture of the downtown experimental scene, will be leading a trio that shows his roots. From 9:30 to midnight, he'll be playing jazz standards. At midnight he'll start playing blues. The $75 ticket includes a four-course dinner and a Champagne toast. P. W.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931224","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/24/arts/art-in-review-851693.html","abstract":"  Howard Hodgkin Knoedler & Company 19 East 70th Street Manhattan Through Jan. 15    Taken one at a time, the best of the paintings in this show of 24 works by the English artist Howard Hodgkin are as shockingly eye-popping and suave as anything he has done: \"Lovers\" (1984-92) is a big work by Mr. Hodgkin's standards, at roughly 6 feet square, its enfolding curves of sherbet orange and green sweeping out of the picture onto its painted frame as if they were figures on television leaping from the set into the living room.

The restaurant, long a landmark and once considered the best American restaurant in New York City, closed in the summer for vacation and never reopened. It has now been permanently closed by the owner, Leon Lianides, who is 76 years old and has not been in good health. The restaurant and building are for sale at an asking price of about $3.5 million.   The Coach House opened in 1949 in what had been a stable for the estate of the Wanamaker family. The restaurant, a clubby place, became a favorite of James Beard's, but was eclipsed by a new wave of American restaurants like An American Place, Gotham Bar and Grill and Arcadia. Its specialties were black bean soup, corn sticks, rack of lamb, prime ribs, chicken pot pie and pecan pie. \"He was a good standard-bearer, one of my idols,\" Joseph Baum, the president of the Rainbow Room complex, said of Mr. Lianides.

Robert De Niro, who owns TriBeCa Grill with Mr. Nieporent and others, and Francis Ford Coppola, whose winery in Napa Valley makes a red called Rubicon, are also partners.

For traditional New York glamour, the Rainbow complex on the 65th floor of the General Electric Building is hard to beat. Recent movies like \"The Prince of Tides\" and \"Six Degrees of Separation,\" which have scenes set in the Rainbow Room, have only added to its mystique. For those with the resources, it offers three different dinner-with-entertainment choices. In all three locations, the events begin at 9 P.M. At the Rainbow Room, Tommy Tune, an entertainer whose exuberance and versatility make him the one-man equivalent of an old-time movie musical (preferrably starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers), is performing his solo cabaret act. There will be dancing to the Rainbow Room Orchestra. Black tie is required, and the price is $375 a guest, including dinner, dancing and the show. Rainbow and Stars, the cabaret around the corner, will have a performance of \"The Leonard Bernstein Revue: A Helluva Town,\" the latest and one of the strongest in its series of shows saluting Broadway composers. The program includes most of Bernstein's best-known theater songs performed by singers -- Lauren Mitchell, J. Mark McVey, Patrick Quinn and Ruth Williamson -- who lend them an appropriately semi-operatic grandeur. Dress is black tie, and the price is $325 a person, including dinner, dancing and the show. The Rainbow Pavilion next door will feature a return New Year's Eve engagement by the Impalas, the Brooklyn vocal group best known for its 1959 hit, \"Sorry (I Ran All the Way Home).\" The group will alternate sets with Uptown, a six-piece pop band. Dress is black tie and the price is $325 a guest, including dinner, dancing and the show. STEPHEN HOLDEN An Alto in the Tea Room    Ann Hampton Callaway, the Russian Tea Room, 150 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-0947. Ann Hampton Callaway's rich, rangy alto is arguably the most the beautiful voice in New York City's cabaret world. It is especially well suited to traditional pop ballads like \"How Deep Is the Ocean\" and \"My Foolish Heart,\" which she imbues with an almost sobbing intensity. New Year's Eve shows are at 9 and 11:30 P.M. There is a $45 music charge and a $30 minimum, and a $50 prix fixe menu. A la carte selections are also available. Dinner seatings are at 8 P.M. for the first show and 10:30 P.M. for the second show, which is already sold out. S. H. Brazilian Ballroom    The Raquel Lima Show, featuring Pe De Boi and Nando Gabrieli, the Ballroom, 253 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-3005. The Ballroom's New Year's Eve extravaganza kicks off the club's fourth annual winter series of Brazilian music with the double bill of a hot jazz singer (Raquel Lima) and a rising young crooner (Nando Gabrieli), both of whom are appearing with a nine-member samba band, Pe De Boi. Miss Lima is an improvisatory scat singer adept in several Afro-Brazilian styles. Mr. Gabrieli, a protege of Sammy Cahn, is only 28, and has been compared with the young Frank Sinatra. The festivities begin at 10 P.M., with dancing after the show until 4 A.M. Tickets are $65 and there is a two-drink minimum. The show continues through Jan. 8 at regular prices. S. H. Come to This Cabaret    Weslia Whitfield, the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-6800, extension 159. A pop-jazz singer with impeccable taste in material and a relaxed and inviting living-room manner, Weslia Whitfield has been San Francisco's most popular cabaret performer for several years, and now she is catching on in New York. On New Year's Eve, she will introduce her new January show, \" 'S Wonderful: the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin\" at the Oak Room, where she has already appeared twice this year.  The performance is at 9:30 P.M. with dinner seating at 7:30 P.M. The price is $195 a person. That includes dinner, the performance, favors and dancing in the lobby. She will also perform at 11 P.M. in the Gallery on the second floor; the cost is $175 a person and includes dinner, favors and dancing. S. H. 2 Packages of Laughs    Caroline's Comedy Club, 1626 Broadway, between 49th and 50th Streets, (212) 757-4100. New York City's sleekest and most comfortable comedy club is offering two different entertainment packages on New Year's Eve. An 8 P.M. dinner package includes a comedy show with five performers: Susie Essman, Dave Attell, Jim David, George Gallo and John Henson. The price, which includes dinner, beer or wine and the show, is $55 a person. For the 10:30 P.M. countdown celebration, the performers are Walli Collins, Nick DiPollo, Ms. Essman, Mr. Gallo and Mr. Henson. The price is $110 a person and includes a choice of party platters, party favors, the show and admission to a post-show dance party. S.

Hours are included for trees inside museums or office buildings. (An introduction appears on page C1.) Metropolitan Museum    Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; closed Mondays, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Open Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve: 9:30 A.M. to 4:45 P.M.    MONIKER: The Medieval Tree.   GETTING THERE: It's inside the museum, so you have to pay the suggested donation ($6; $3 for the elderly and students).   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: Situated in the Medieval Hall, that solemn, cavernous first-floor gallery with high ceilings, pillars and an enormous metal gate dividing the room. Wan light trickles in from some faraway, high-up source. Strange, severe artifacts gaze down from walls and pedestals: pale, delicate tapestries of forest scenes, rounded counte nances of the Virgin Mary, statuettes of bearded and red-coated fellows with fixed, accusing stares. This hushed, darkened sanctuary has the effect of making people behave as if they were walking through some ancient church or monastery: voices drop to low tones; laughter evaporates; expressions reflect the imposed reverence.   SIZE AND SHAPE: Tall and skinny, stretching up toward that distant source of light.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: As you enter the Medieval Hall, the tree unfolds like some proud, elaborate artwork unto itself.   DECORATIONS: This really is a rather highfalutin specimen: it has its own explanatory text posted nearby. To be precise, we're dealing with a Baroque Neapolitan Christmas Creche, produced in Naples in the second half of the 18th century. Dozens of figurines are spread around the base of the tree: shepherds with sheep, kings mounted upon elephants and camels, slaves carrying bundles of wood, oxen poking their heads out from behind lower branches, deer, goats, donkeys, rearing horses. Bodies are made of wrapped twine and wire, and the attire is original 18th-century costumes: the rich guys have great big, pillowy hats and children carrying their garment trains, while the poor folks are suitably dressed in rags. The heads and shoulders were made by Neapolitan sculptors, and there are even architectural backgrounds nestled among the branches: tile-roofed houses, vine-draped walls, a Baroque fountain, the remains of a Roman temple. Scattered on the ground is that mossy green stuff, like the kind you see in model train sets.   The branches are decorated with angels in different-colored robes, holding little electric candles and incense. Cherubs are poised in flight. They seem to be literally bursting out of the interior of the tree.   OF SPECIAL NOTE: The manger is set up on the temple steps at the front of the tree. According to the text, this is meant to represent the triumph of Christianity over ancient religions. So this tree comes with a moral.   STAR: Gold-and-silver tinselly starburst.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: With utter fealty and deference. Patrons of the Met come to pay homage to this tree. Middle-aged intellectual types with spectacles down on their noses give private dissertations among their friends. \"We come every year,\" effused one fatherly type. \"This is our favorite thing.\" \"It's beautiful,\" breathed another. A gray-haired woman in a plaid dress said to her companions: \"I'm sure there's a postcard in the store. If we can't get one today, I'll send one to you.\" Even the children seemed impressed: they scampered around, oohing and ahhing at the different animals.   SOUNDTRACK: Gregorian chants and medieval carols echo through the air.   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: Now that you've paid admission, why not enjoy the rest of the museum? Take in a couple of Rembrandts and Rubenses. Admire the installation of the antique French storefront. Marvel at van Gogh, the punk rocker of art history. And if you need a real respite from all this decorum, find yourself a couple of Winslow Homers, which will knock you out with their simplicity and emotional directness.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: A very big deal. New York Public Library    Fifth Avenue at 42d Street; (212) 869-8089. Holiday hours: Sunday, noon to 5 P.M.; Monday and Thursday, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Tuesday and Wednesday, 11 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. Closed Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.   MONIKER: No special name, although a scientist studying this sort of thing might dub it the Ornithological Tree.   GETTING THERE: One must endure the crush of the Grand Central area, but the library itself is done up with great festivity. Even the lions wear wreaths around their necks, embellished with bows and lights.   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: The tree is installed in the vestibule, opposite the front doors and between the stairwells. It's a pretty addition to the noble, neo-classical design of the room, with its vaulted ceiling, white marble archways and pillars. The interior features more holiday touches: pine garlands, big red bows, menorahs.   SIZE AND SHAPE: Kind of prickly and pointy, rising up a good portion of the two-story hallway.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: It's quite nice to sit on the marble stairs and watch the people come and go around the tree.   DECORATIONS: This tree is so generously decorated you can hardly see any green. Hundreds of electric candles poke out from the tips of branches, giving the tree a vaguely pagodalike look. There's a dusting of fake snow on the needles, plus the glitter of tiny white lights. The real attraction are the ornamental birds in a variety of poses and sizes: bluebirds with spread wings, cardinals with cocked heads, giant yellow-eyed owls with speckled feathers, screeching blue jays. Some birds are nesting; others seem poised for flight. There are brown birds and white birds, pink birds and yellow birds. More birds grace the pine rope garlands, which keep spectators at bay. Fake snow is sprinkled on the ground; birds hop through it. Birds, birds, birds! You could go a little bird-crazy looking at all of them.   OF SPECIAL NOTE: I tried to get a little more information from a kindly-faced woman at the information desk. With her gray hair pulled tight in a bun, ivory skin and Christmasy red sweater, she seemed pleasingly evocative of the Mrs. Claus type. Are the ornaments old? I asked her, and she looked a bit confused. \"No, no,\" she answered. \"This is the same tree we have every year. I haven't been informed that it's anything unusual. A few years ago, three, four years ago, we had a very special tree, a Japanese tree that was all made out of paper.\" Origami? \"Yes, yes. All handmade. It was very beautiful. But this is just your simple, ordinary tree.\"   STAR: No star on top. Nothing.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: Most stop for a moment on their way into the library. A few parents bring their children in especially to see the tree. Elderly women with scarves on their heads and several shopping bags in their hands stand and gaze admiringly.   SOUNDTRACK: The scuffle of feet, the hum of busy voices, the muffled roar of Fifth Avenue traffic.   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: Millions of books, magazines and periodicals, as well as the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibition.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: Functionally sound. This tree may not warrant a special trip (unless you're an ornithologist), but for those passing through the library it's a welcome reminder of the season.  Lincoln Center    Broadway at 65th Street. Lights go off at 1 A.M      MONIKER: You might call it the Symphony Tree.   GETTING THERE: Easy, except at peak performance hours.   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: Situated in the Fountain Plaza. And really, woefully little has been done to dress the place up otherwise. A couple of small potted trees with white lights stand around, but other than that, the tree rises up stark and lonesome from its concrete bed, uncomfortably evoking those suburban housing developments where each tract of land has been flattened and cleared of vegetation except for a single transplanted tree. It somehow looks lost and unnatural, all alone there in that big empty plaza. Unadorned steel barriers surround it, adding to the alienation factor. Cables anchored to the ground hold it in place.   SIZE AND SHAPE: Smooth, trim. A great big triangle.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: From a distance -- hurtling down Broadway in a speeding cab, for instance -- it's nice to look up and see the tree flash past. But up close, it's a little disappointing.   DECORATIONS: Covered from tip to foot with bright-colored lights: red, blue, purple, gold, green. Interspersed among them are weird shapes in white lights that are meant to be the outlines of musical instruments and related motifs. However, the shapes are so nebulous that it kind of defeats the purpose. A little girl was walking by, holding her father's hand. \"Guitars!\" she screamed. Well, no, actually, they're violins. \"Saxophones!\" she shrieked. Wrong again, that's not a saxophone, it's a -- what? Bassoon? Wait -- it's a trombone! Yes! And an anatomically incorrect trombone at that. It's missing a mouthpiece, so it looks rather like a giant white paper clip that flares at one end.   A friend and I were intently studying a couple of big white blobs in the northeastern region of the tree. We crept up to the metal barriers. We were the only people there. \"Oh, I get it,\" said my friend, after several moments' pause. \"Look, you can see the pale outlines of the shapes underneath the lights. Those aren't blobs. They're drama masks.\" Lo and behold, he was right: we could faintly make out these tracer patterns with the faces of comedy and tragedy. Then there were these thin, somewhat vertical blobs. My friend said they were conductors with raised arms about to bring down their batons. To this day I do not quite believe him.   OF SPECIAL NOTE: On the far side of the tree there is in fact a guitar, but it's much smaller than the violin. So does that mean the violin is actually a viola? How about a cello? Oh, my, how confusing.   STAR: A white snowflake light on top.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: A couple walked up with their arms around each other. Although it was only about 5:30 on a weekday afternoon, few people racing through the plaza were stopping to look at the tree, which made its metal barriers seem all the more pointless. \"Wow,\" said the man. Strangely, he was looking not at the tree but at a point in the night sky. \"Wow, it's a beautiful moon tonight,\" he said.   SOUNDTRACK: All the music is sequestered inside the buildings.    NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: All of Lincoln Center. All of Columbus Circle. Record stores, movie theaters, clothing stores, anything! Just keep moving.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: This symphony might need a little bit more work. Japan Airlines    655 Fifth Avenue, at 52d Street. Spotlights on 24 hours a day.   MONIKER: The Origami Tree.   GETTING THERE: Ack! Midtown Manhattan on Christmas Eve! Tourists from all lands stampeding between Rockefeller Center, Bergdorf Goodman and F. A. O. Schwarz! This is no New Yorker's idea of a smart place to be. But believe me now: it's worth it.   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: The tree is just inside the Japan Airlines office, but the enormous picture windows allow an excellent view. For peak festivity and communal experience, stand out front and press your nose against the glass.   SIZE AND SHAPE: Exactly 12 feet 7 inches. The shape is a perfect cone: no branches sticking out, no spindly parts on top, no sagging or irregular branches. As perfect as geometry. Every available square millimeter of surface space is covered with origami ornaments of incalculable variety. And get this: the tree turns. That's right, it spins on some unseen, highly technological axis.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: From a distance, it's impossible to discern the details of the literally thousands of origami ornaments; the tree looks like one giant crumple of paper. Even from up close, the details are still nigh impossible to sort out, but certainly the closer the better.   DECORATIONS: As you stand outside watching the tree turn, a few of the bigger, more obvious ornaments begin to stand out. Like the gorilla holding an old-fashioned, Y-in-the-middle subway token. Or the Statue of Liberty, surrounded by a circle of little stars. There are green origami cactuses and silver dive-bombing airplanes. Red lobsters and pale blue sailboats. Dinosaurs, a rhinoceros and flying dragons. As you look at it a little longer, strange, cryptic shapes begin to pop up. Handbags. Cameras. Shoes. Plus lots and lots of red hearts, all made from paper.   As I was standing on 52d Street, trying to get a handle on all this, I heard a polite voice over my shoulder. \"Can I help you?\" said the voice. There was an older fellow in a bright red, hooded jacket and a tweedy snap-brim cap, looking at me out of a pair of sky-blue eyes. \"Do you have any questions about my tree?\" said the fellow. He craned his neck and peered at my notebook. \"What are you writing?\"    \"Your tree?\" I said. \"Did you make all the ornaments?\"   \"I made 90 percent of them: I made all except the ones that are by the person who originally designed them,\" he said. He was off and running, just from that one question. \"My name is Michael Shall,\" he continued. \"This is my tree. I designed it and put the ornaments up. Every day I go in there and clean and care for it and clean off the pretzel crumbs. That's because people point and say, 'Look at that one!' \" He flung his arm out to demonstrate tourists pointing with pretzels in their hands. \"I just got back from Holland, where I did a 46-foot origami tree,\" he offered. \"It was trimmed by mountain climbers hanging down on ropes.\"   He smiled in the warmest, most persuasive way. \"I'm an origami specialist,\" he said. \"I want the whole world to fold paper.\"   Mr. Shall went on to dispense an incredible wealth of information, not just about his tree but about himself. He said he had been in his unusual profession for 17 years and that he had decorated some 99 trees. He is the origami specialist for the American Museum of Natural History, and he designs its origami tree, too, but he doesn't personally trim it. The Japan Airlines tree gets a fanatical amount of care. Sure, at first it appears to be a random assortment of designs. But Mr. Shall has constructed his tree with the meticulous precision of a Shakespearean sonnet. Every ornament means something to him and is juxtaposed with ornaments with related meanings.   \"Look, you see right there, where it says 'I Love A.M.N.H.'?\" he said. \"That's because I love the Museum of Natural History. And you see the figure placed just below it? That's the president of the museum waving her arm, saying, 'Come to my museum!'   \"You see that cat down there?\" he said, pointing to an ornament near the bottom on the tree. \"That cat has a clipped tail. That's because it's my cat, and he lost his tail during the trimming of the tree. He had a tumor and had to have it removed. I had to come in and fold the tail down. Would you like a peppermint?\" He offered me a Life Saver.   \"You see that one there? That's King Kong holding a subway token. You see over there? That's a pair of pears. Right down there, I have the inside of my house. I have an ornament for everyone in my building. Edna, she's my landlady. That shoe over there, that's for a woman in my building who likes to wear incredibly high heels.\"   He said there were more than 5,000 pieces of origami altogether on and around the tree, and that the trimming took him 240 hours.    He pointed out a clown in the upper reaches of the tree. \"You see that one?\" he said. \"That's me.\"   OF SPECIAL NOTE: The origami creche at the base of the tree. \"Someone from a newspaper came to take a picture, and they said: 'Where's Jesus? There's no Jesus in the manger,' \" Mr. Shall recalled. \"I said: 'Of course not. That's because it's not Christmas yet.' \" Mr. Shall leaned forward and divulged a bit of secret information. \"He's asleep under the manger,\" he admitted. \"I keep him there because one year I lost the baby Jesus. I was up all night on Christmas Eve frantically folding a new one.\"   STAR: A brightly, sparkling gold star. A side note: the tree is officially called \"Paper Magic: The Origami Holiday Tree.\" Mr. Shall's designs are not creed-specific.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: Look, I can't vouch for everyone, but I was completely enthralled.    SOUNDTRACK: Find Mr. Shall and allow him to supply the running commentary.   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: Pale by comparison.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: If the heart of the season is the giving of joy, Mr. Shall and his tree bestow more than their share. City Hall    Broadway and Park Row. For information and hours: (212) 788-4636.   MONIKER: The Low-Budget, New-York-Is-Still-in-a-Slump Tree   GETTING THERE: You just need to weave between all the town cars with tinted windows parked in front of City Hall.   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: In the middle of the park in front of City Hall. The park is low-key, but clean and relatively serene: just quiet trees, shrubs, a few paved paths and benches. City Hall is decorated with red, white and blue banners, which aren't exactly holiday-specific but add to the festive feeling.   SIZE AND SHAPE: A tiny bit lopsided -- vaguely S-shaped, even.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: From inside the park, or from Park Row.   DECORATIONS: Fiscally conservative -- just colored lights in long vertical strings. It's simple but effective, especially for an outdoor tree. The City Hall Tree is a kind of junior sibling to the Rockefeller Center tree: same principle, but lacking the grand scale.   OF SPECIAL NOTE: A sign is posted in the park: \"Holiday Tree and Lighting Courtesy of Country Living.\" So the city didn't even pay for it.   STAR: A pretty, white-lit five-point star.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: A couple of folks were sitting on the park benches, happily gazing. And the workers coming to and from City Hall would give it a happy glance. The pigeons, however, paid it no special attention.   SOUNDTRACK:The park seemed peaceful and quiet in the gray afternoon winter light.   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: The gorgeous, turn-of-the-century brownstone and brick buildings across the street once housed New York's Newspaper Row.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: The area has a subdued, old-town charm, although it feels more somber and reflective than celebratory. Rockefeller Center    Off Fifth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. Lighted 24 hours a day.   MONIKER: THE TREE -- capital THE, capital TREE. The big daddy, the big kahuna, only, the king of them all.   GETTING THERE: See Japan Airlines tree.   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: At this time of year, Rockefeller Center is probably the most international spot in the city. As you bustle through the promenade toward the skating rink, you are likely to hear all manner of foreign languages. Even the stores around here have a multicultural aura: Librairie de France, Teuscher Chocolatier, Crabtree & Evelyn, etc. And if all this is starting to feel like a Benetton ad for world peace, then just put a lid on your cynicism, because at the end of the promenade, on the other side of the skating rink, with the vast sky-scraping facade of 30 Rockefeller Center serving as its backdrop, is the most beautiful, heart-stopping, majestic and awesome tree of all time, transcending commercialism and crowds and all the hype that comes with the holidays.   SIZE AND SHAPE: Its mammoth branches droop provocatively, all shaggy and forest-green, as if laden with imaginary snow; it towers so tall and mighty that nearly all of New York City fits beneath it.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: Anywhere in the promenade, from the street all the way to the rink. When you turn that corner and see it for the first time, it takes your breath away.   DECORATIONS: What ornaments could deck it? Just colored lights shivering and twinkling among the branches.   OF SPECIAL NOTE: Do not underestimate the tree's power of romance. Bring your significant other.   STAR: Again, simple yet utterly tasteful: just a white, bright, five-point star. That's all you need.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: Uniform delight. All who walk the promenade raise their eyes toward it; to all faces, it brings that spontaneous, un-self-conscious smile. Teen-agers are giggling and chatting; maintenance workers will wink at you. Middle-aged men smile at young girls, and it doesn't feel creepy. Elderly women in hats and gloves momentarily forget their age. Strangers talk to one another without fear or hesitation. I'm telling you, it's magic.   SOUNDTRACK: Christmas carols from the skating rink; jingle bells from the sidewalk barkers, soliciting money for the homeless or the Salvation Army.   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: Go ahead, go ice skating. It's one of those touristy New York experiences that all New Yorkers should try at some point in their lives.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: Incomparable. For just a moment, the tree can make the world melt away, can dissolve the hubbub and hectic stress of the holiday season. For just a moment, it can bring a silent and somehow holy breath of peace into your heart.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931224","headline":"Poorhouses, Pamphlets and Marley's Ghost","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/24/opinion/poorhouses-pamphlets-and-marleys-ghost.html","abstract":"One dark afternoon in January, I sat at a round table in the library on East 36th Street in New York City from which J.

He yowls, leers and swaggers through his own songs and rediscovered obscurities like the testosterone boast of \"Red Hot.\" For the early show, Mr. Gordon performs at 11 P.M., following the Hassan Hamid swing band, which begins about 9:30 P.M; tickets are $30 including a Champagne toast. The late show, with Mr. Hamid's band at 12:30 A.M. and Mr. Gordon about 2 A.M., costs $20. J. P. Funk at Maxwell's    Luscious Jackson, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. Minimalist funk grooves and knowing, off-handed vocals from women who are proud to be cool. Sexpod opens at 10:30 P.M. Tickets are $12.50 in advance, $15 at the door. J. P. Wine in the Wetlands    God Street Wine, Wetlands, 161 Hudson Street, TriBeCa, (212) 966-4225. A neo-hippie band that mixes the usual strong Grateful Dead influences with touches of progressive-rock precision and, now and then, a rap. Doors open at 9 P.M.; admission is $20. J. P. Happy Together Again    The Turtles featuring Flo and Eddie, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300.

On New Year's Eve, there is one show at 10:30 P.M.; tickets are $27.50. The group also appears Wednesday and Thursday and Jan. 1, with shows at 7:30 and 10:30 P.M.; tickets are $17.50. J. P. Audible Export    Nina Hagen, Tunnel, 220 12th Avenue, at 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 695-7292. Blasphemy, erotic bravado, operatic vocals and dance-music rhythms from one of Germany's strangest exports. Doors open at 10 P.M., with recorded music until Ms. Hagen performs at 2 A.M. Admission is $40. J. P. The G-7 of Blues    Bob Gaddy, Jimmy Spruill, Jimmy Dale and others, Tramps Cafe, 45 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. A New York blues summit, with half a dozen singers, pianists and guitarists trading boasts and woes. Shows at 9 and 11 P.M. and 1 A.M.; admission is $15. J. P. Traveling Men    Blues Traveler, Roseland, 239 West 52d Street, Manhattan, (212) 247-0200. Speed-demon harmonica solos and drawn-out blues jams for a tie-dyed, barefooted crowd that missed the real thing in the 1960's. Appearing Thursday (tickets $20 in advance, $25 on the day of the show) at 8 P.M., and New Year's Eve (tickets $30 in advance, $35 on New Year's Eve) at 10 P.M. J. P. Big Band on 53d Street    The Artie Shaw Orchestra, the Citicorp Atrium, 53d Street and Lexington Avenue, (212) 371-3367. The suave arrangements of Artie Shaw's big band brought him pop success without entirely erasing his jazz credibility. The 17-piece band, now directed by Dick Johnson, makes a rare New York appearance; Mr. Shaw, who is 83, no longer performs. Tickets, including a five-course dinner at Alfredo the Original of Rome, are $149 a person, including tax and tip; the band performs between 9 P.M. and 3 A.M. J.

Some writers consider the practice a crime and torture, and reproach Africans for not taking action to stop it. Another calls it a joyous occasion for the girls who undergo the operation.   The motives behind this mobilization could be genuine human concern about the \"poor Africans.\" But at the same time those who are dealing with the problem and who are familiar with the situation cannot help asking whether or not the writers have cared to inform themselves about the efforts that Africans are making to deal with the problem.   Those who are genuinely concerned about the hazardous consequences of female genital mutilation will be glad to learn that African women and men have organized themselves under the umbrella of the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, and they are campaigning in their own way to eradicate the custom.   This committee was set up in 1984, following the will of the African participants in a seminar on traditional practices held in Dakar, Senegal.   Since then, 24 national affiliates, or committees, have been established. In collaboration with their respective governments and other nongovernmental organizations, they are conducting programs to educate, inform and sensitize their populations about these practices.   Those in the United States who are genuinely concerned about female genital mutilation would be well advised to visit Benin, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Uganda to discuss and consult with the nationals of these countries and to witness the changes that are taking place.

 Bridge books and columns are well-provided with examples of brilliant moves by experts, who then bask in the limelight. Invariably omitted are the occasions on which an expert tries to be brilliant and emerges with egg on his face. A fine example is the diagramed deal from the 1993 Spingold Knockout Team, played in July in Washington.   It will be seen that North-South went off the rails in the bidding, and reached six hearts lacking two aces, a misfortune that the Blackwood convention, now 60 years old, was intended to prevent. The two-club response was game-forcing in the partnership style, but nevertheless it would seem that South had done enough by reversing and then cue-bidding. If he had bid four hearts after his partner's four-club cue-bid, the bidding would have ended at a safe level. His jump to five hearts demanded that his partner continue if he had first- or second-round diamond control. He had, and he did.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931225","headline":"If Only Bert Were Here","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/25/opinion/if-only-bert-were-here.html","abstract":"When the cat died, his ashes packed into a cheesy, pink-posied tin and placed high upon the mantel, the house seemed lonely and Aileen began to drink.

Another voice joined the chorus, somebody in the band picked up a cowbell and added a new percussion figure, and suddenly the group reached the level all great dance bands have to reach to make a living. What had been eight men working became a unit willing to turn the communal experience into something transcendental, to use physical movement and music's sensuality as a release from the mundane.   The song, \"The Peanut Vendor,\" ended up being an Afro-Cuban suite. It started out smoothly, with Hiram Remon singing almost introspectively. Figures and rhythmic riffs were added. The performance changed mood, picking up the gravity of a great groove, and as it hit the improvisation section, the band blossomed. Lewis Kahn on violin improvised first, then turned the last few notes of his solo into a riff that was picked up by the rest of the band; the saxophonist Gene Jefferson improvised next. Mr. Kahn shifted the riff around, and the band picked that up as well. Mr. Sanabria soloed next, his rhythmic patterns, abrupt and short and precise, standing stock still amid the tumult.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931225","headline":"For Burma's Minorites, a Reckoning","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/25/opinion/IHT-for-burmas-minorites-a-reckoning.html","abstract":"Burma's ethnic minorities in revolt against the military rulers in Rangoon are facing a growing crisis that threatens their ability to achieve autonomy and other goals for which they have been fighting for more than 40 years.

My husband and I are considering going to Lourdes from Paris next April and would like to know about train and plane service between the two cities. -- Rita M. Solomon, Masontown, Pa.   A. To get to Lourdes, you can fly from Orly to either the Tarbes or Pau Airport. A single Air Inter flight operates daily, departing at 10:55 A.M. and arriving at Tarbes Airport, six miles from Lourdes, at 12:10 P.M. (1:40 P.M. on Sunday). Up to four flights a day serve Pau, which is 25 miles west of Lourdes. Bus service links both airports to Lourdes. For flight information, call (800) 237-2747.   Most passengers can take advantage of the Visite Fare of about $176 round trip (coded YAP) if they buy a ticket to Tarbes or Pau when getting an international ticket. Another favorable fare is the Super Loisir, which is about $141 round trip; it requires a Saturday night stay.    The T.G.V., or high-speed train, which takes 5 hours and 20 minutes, departs from Gare Montparnasse in Paris at 8:10 A.M., 2 P.M. and 5:40 P.M.

The charge in 1994: $180 for first class, $125 for second class. Information: Rail Europe, (800) 438-7245. A one-way ticket bought in France is $100 to $116 for first class and $67 to $76 for second class. But there are no extra fees.  Opera With Surtitles    Q.

In journalism, by the same token, war reporting is simpler, but covering labor disputes is hard. The labor reporter confronts an eruption of passion, a fog of conflicting claims over arcane details, self-serving leaks from closed-door negotiations and real or perceived pressure from potent antagonists. To write fairly and clearly about a bitter strike requires persistence and tact, analytical skill and a safecracker's nerves.   A. H. Raskin displayed those qualities during his many years as labor reporter for The New York Times. Though invariably writing against deadlines, Mr. Raskin, who died Wednesday at 82, rarely sinned against fact or fairness. It was a feat that became his trademark, beginning with his coverage of the Great Depression in the 1930's and continuing until his final years as assistant editor of this page in the 1970's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Christina Ittleson, Sean P.

Its urgent postwar mixture of banks and advertising agencies, trade fairs and skyscrapers, doesn't have much of a precedent in German history, and the city, on weekdays, at least, can move at a bustling, un-Germanlike pace.  Frankfurt, in fact, has the highest percentage of resident foreigners of any German city, and it was probably this international flavor (and accompanying vagueness) that allowed it to reinvent itself in the 1980's with such dramatic flair. Not merely content -- actually, not at all content -- with being the country's financial center, Frankfurt embarked on a spree of museum construction that has placed it in contention with Munich, Berlin and Cologne for the title of Kunststadt, or city of art. \n\nThe most significant project, called the Museumsufer, or Museum Embankment, promoted the establishment of new museums, as well as the refurbishment or rehousing of nearby existing museums, on the Schaumainkai, the tree-lined avenue along the left bank of the Main River. The Museum Embankment, which was planned in the late 1970's and has just entered its finishing stages in the last couple of years, was meant to create an alternative kind of urbanity to the financial district and the neighborhood behind the train station, a red-light district that most Germans dismiss as a smaller, less compelling version of Hamburg's Reeperbahn. Consquently, many of the museums maintain beautiful parks, cafes and libraries.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Death Comes to the Professor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/books/death-comes-to-the-professor.html","abstract":"  LITERARY MURDER A Critical Case.

As a freshman at Smith College in Massachusetts, very far from my home in Ames, Iowa, I read about Travel Time in the students' handbook. Christmas vacation at Smith always began at a sternly precise minute -- 12:50 P.M., as I remember -- and failure to register in that last morning class, on what was called an Official Calendar Day, brought dire punishment.   But those few students who lived beyond the Mississippi were eligible for travel time. If they could satisfactorily prove to the registrar that their journey took more than 36 hours, they were allowed to leave up to 48 hours early. All that first fall I had been desperately homesick, marking off each alien day until I could return to my loved and familiar Midwest. Two days early? Incredulous, but hopeful, I read that paragraph in the handbook again. Quickly I figured my train connections. First the Boston & Maine commuter from Northampton to Springfield, then the long-haul New York Central to Chicago and finally the stop-and-go, rackety ride on the Chicago & Northwestern right into the Ames station. At first my total was several hours short, but I judiciously adjusted here and there until I came up with an only slightly padded figure of 37. Suddenly it was as if someone had erased two days from an immutable sentence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Sports of The Times; Postcards From an Odd Year: Here to There and Then Back Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-postcards-from-an-odd-year-here-to-there-and-then-back-again.html","abstract":"  ODD-NUMBERED years are odd.

The basis of support for policing our society must come from all citizens. Given this basic tenet, it follows that police agencies should be representative of the populations they serve.

Thanks to documents released on United States activities in El Salvador we know that the Ambassador reported to Washington that United States military advisers had for some time been training the Salvadoran civilian financiers of the death squads -- in his words, \"gun-toting Soldier of Fortune-magazine-subscribing, rich young extremists\" -- at United States expense. As you report (front page, Dec. 14), Mr. Walker stopped the training, over our military's objections.   After the sordid disclosures of a dozen years of United States policy in El Salvador, his indignant tone rings slightly off-key. Indeed, embarrassed Pentagon officials wondered aloud if Mr. Walker had not read their memos informing him that United States advisers were providing weapons and training to those they agreed were \"pretty much\" as the Ambassador described them.    Who, let alone the United States Ambassador, could be surprised that our tax dollars supported private war games with Salvadorans known to bankroll death squad activities? Or amazed that, as you report, the United States military defended its wealthy students because they merely paid others to kill, and resisted Mr. Walker's attempt to halt the training, so as not to insult the military sponsor of the trainees, himself among the worst human rights offenders?    Outrageous? Certainly. Astonishing? Not really.   The Reagan Administration conceived of, financed and trained the Salvadoran army's \"elite\" Atlacatl Battalion, which made El Mozote a household name in human rights circles by massacring an entire town of 700 civilians in 1981. The Bush Administration was still training the Atlacatl on Nov. 13, 1989, three days before its commandos marched into the Jesuit university residence to murder six priests and two women.    In the Jesuit case, and other instances when embarrassed by Salvadoran clients, United States officials, including Mr. Walker, offered denials, followed by limited admissions in the face of mounting proof and, ultimately, questionable accounts of what they knew and when they knew it.   Successive administrations provide the American public with new examples of official credulity tinged with cynicism. Most recently, Clinton Administration officials intoned their respect for the professionalism of Haiti's military leaders, despite rampant officially sponsored terror, only to express shock and outrage when military henchmen scared off United States ships carrying military trainers and then shot the Justice Minister, Guy Malary, to death on the streets of Port-au-Prince.    As a Nov. 14 front-page article disclosed, United States officials have reasons to know better. Senior members of a military intelligence and counternarcotics unit, formed and paid by the Central Intelligence Agency, ran drugs, engaged in political terror and threatened to kill the local Drug Enforcement Agency chief.   For many Haitians, including the martyred Justice Minister and likely the exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the damage is irreversible.    New death squad killings in El Salvador offer the United States an opportunity to restore some squandered credibility on human rights by pushing for investigations and prosecutions, regardless of where the evidence leads. In Haiti, United States diplomats must insure that the military's aggression is not rewarded, as some fear, with a blanket amnesty, an infusion of foreign funds and a pliant civilian government in exchange for a face-saving exit for United States policy.   As Haiti and El Salvador slide into news media eclipse, only public attention will police our leaders. In a sense, those United States trainers of death squad patrons have done their country a service. They have reminded all of us beyond any lingering doubt that our Government cannot be trusted to police itself.  ROBERT O.

The new, united Germany is finding that the post-cold-war world is a more harshly competitive place than it was before.

But as they have become parents themselves, many have been forced to grapple anew with the place of religion in their lives.   Theirs is often a wrenching search. They are torn between guilt, reluctance and nostalgia, between the sense that religion would be good for their children and their own lack of belief in some spiritual doctrines, as well as their discomfort with the way many religious institutions are run. A Sense of Duty    In a society that seems more frightening and amoral than ever, many parents say they yearn for a moral safety net, a place that will reinforce the values they hope to teach at home. Others feel they should at least expose children to religion, as a possible source of comfort and faith. Still others conclude that religion is not the answer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Why I'm the Poet I've Become: Berryman and the Lucky 13","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/books/why-im-the-poet-ive-become-berryman-and-the-lucky-13.html","abstract":"I CAN'T say if all poets have had mentors, actual living, breathing masters who stood or sat before them making the demands that true mentors must make if the fledgling is ever to fly. Some poets seem to have been totally self-starting, like the cars they used to build in Detroit; I'm thinking of such extraordinary examples as Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, who over a hundred years ago created not only their own gigantic works but the beginnings of something worthy enough to be American poetry, and they did it out of their imaginations and their private studies and nothing more. But then they had the advantage of being geniuses. And neither was from Detroit.\n\nI think also of those poets who had to be poets, whom no one or nothing short of death could have derailed from their courses -- John Keats, Dylan Thomas, Arthur Rimbaud -- and who outstripped their mentors before they even got into second gear. There are those who were lucky enough to find among their peers people of equal talent and insight to help them on their way -- poets like William Carlos Williams and Ezra Pound, who for the crucial early years of their writing careers ignited each other.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Living Where Edison Filmed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/nyregion/neighborhood-report-bedford-park-living-where-edison-filmed.html","abstract":"  Construction of a much-awaited apartment building for the low-income elderly was completed earlier this month at the very spot where Thomas A.

He discovered his toy in the early 1960's, around the time Leo Castelli gave him his first one-man show, and after that he was scarcely to be caught painting without it. Indeed, even though Diane Waldman, the author of ROY LICHTENSTEIN (Guggenheim Museum/Rizzoli, $59.95) -- the hefty, bright catalogue for the artist's retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum through Jan. 16 -- quotes him as saying, \"I want my painting to look as if it has been programmed. I want to hide the record of my hand,\" he obviously has had no such luck. The Benday dots are the record of his own hand, and it is one of the most recognizable hands around. Conveniently for Ms. Waldman, the Guggenheim's deputy director, who is sometimes a bit too ponderous about her subject, Mr. Lichtenstein's untroubled and uncomplicated life's work fits neatly into thematic chapters: his caricatures of comic strips, of advertisements, landscapes, brush strokes, mirrors, entablatures, still lifes, various Expressionist, Surrealist and Futurist paintings, and interiors of suburban houses. We see the artist latching onto a theme, playing it out and then easing into the next theme, often looking casually backward to incorporate elements of his past paintings into the new ones. The amazing thing is that regardless of Mr. Lichtenstein's subject he has been able to hold the same ironic pose for 30 years without flinching. His consistent style serves somewhat the same role as a person with an unchangeably wry expression. Just as the wry look seems to take on different meanings depending on what it confronts, so Mr. Lichtenstein's Benday dots and flat primary colors read like a running commentary, pointing out the proper objects for parody at each moment and suggesting that at some point virtually everything is fair game.

In the visitor's locker room at Madison Square Garden, a man who goes by the name Bam Bam sat on a trainer's table with his mouth open and his face in a grimace of pain. He had been hit in the face by an intentionally errant hockey stick that happened to belong to a player from New York. One tooth was broken off at the gum line, the nerve exposed. Another was bent at such an angle that Bam Bam -- better known as Scott Stevens, now with the New Jersey Devils -- could not close his mouth.

Mr. McGrath states that \"9 out of 10 times they can't recall a thing.\" He does not think that there is much sexual abuse and he concludes that \"there does certainly appear to be a lot of people in the mental health field fueling their careers on it.\"   What the literature on the subject shows is quite different from Mr. McGrath's views. The American Humane Society's clearinghouse on child abuse show that 60,000 to 100,000 children are sexually abused annually in the United States; this is equivalent to saying that 10 to 14 percent of American families are affected by child sexual abuse each year. According to the researchers, Kee MacFarlane and Dr. Jill Waterman, in a study done in 1986, current reliable estimates range from 100,000 to 500,000 cases per year and another study, done in 1980 suggests that one-fourth to one-third of all children have at least one sexual experience with an adult. Further, studies show that the vast majority of victims of incestuous abuse are females and approximately 98 percent of the perpetrators are males.

The Manhattan Beach Community Group had complained that a 6-foot cyclone fence built by Jack Laboz of 293 Amherst Street interrupted the seven-block walkway connecting Manhattan Beach and Brighton Beach. But on Dec. 15, Justice Leonard E. Yoswein dismissed contentions that the esplanade is a public easement. The group, made up of 800 residents, plans to appeal.   * FORT GREENE    The future of the South Oxford Tennis Club, the city's only black-owned tennis club, remains uncertain after construction began this month on Atlantic Center, a major revitalization effort in Fort Greene.   The city, which owns the club's land, told its owner, Richard Northern, in August that the club would have to close in November to make room for moderate- to middle-income housing in the Atlantic Center, a commercial and residential complex. But Mr. Northern, the founder of the club at 187 South Oxford Street, has refused to close the building and has pressured city officials to include it in the redevelopment plan.   The developer, the Forest City Ratner Companies, now says it is unsure whether the club, in a three-story neo-Georgian structure on the fringe of the Fort Greene Historic District, will have to close.   On Dec. 14, construction began on a Bradlees department store near Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues and Hanson Place. The store is to occupy about 120,000 square feet on two stories and serve as Atlantic Center's anchor tenant in 210,000 square feet of commercial space.   * PROSPECT PARK    A police task force patrolling the cultural institutions around Prospect Park has been increased to 21 officers from 14 to create a feeling of safety for visitors.

The creation of the task force in 1991-92 and the recent increase in staff was recommended by Borough President Howard Golden's Crown Heights Coalition, which was worried that visitors would be frightened away after the 1991 racial disturbances. No increase in crime has been reported, the police say.

These include files which had been presumptuously spirited from the office of the deputy White House counsel, Vincent Foster, following Mr. Foster's suicide.   Mr. Clinton's action falls well short of full and immediate public disclosure of the files. But it spares him a potentially embarrassing fight with his own Attorney General, Janet Reno, whose investigators had threatened to subpoena the files. The investigators are looking into the collapse of Madison Guaranty, an Arkansas savings and loan whose owner, James McDougal, was the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater Development Corporation, which also went bust in a speculative land venture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/nyregion/c-corrections-895293.html","abstract":"  An article last Sunday about traffic problems in New York included an outdated reference to the 79th Street Transverse through Central Park.

Even the hot young chefs are at their most thrilling when they \"interpret\" (as they call it) the traditional dishes of the surrounding Lazio region. Foreign restaurants, though no longer countable only on the fingers, are still largely ignored by both the public and, it is my impression, other restaurateurs. One way to satisfy the yen for something a little different is to go to a restaurant serving the cuisine of another region of Italy. Dal Bolognese    Bologna is to Italian food more or less what Stratford-upon-Avon is to English literature. The Emilia-Romagna region, of which Bologna is the capital, is the home of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and prosciutto di Parma, spinach pasta, tortellini, fabulous sausages and meat sauces that are made of meat, not tomato.    The challenge for a restaurant is basically just not to make any mistakes or to let the classic turn stale.   It was the lasagne verdi at Dal Bolognese that made me fall in love with Italian food some 20 years ago. (At least it was what led me to buy the first book by Marcella Hazan, a native of Emilia-Romagna, after which there was no going back.) When I returned last month, lasagne verdi was still on the menu and still inspiring.    The pasta was lightly flecked with spinach, the bechamel unobtrusive, and together they provided a squishy cushion for the tender little chunks of meat (not ground meat) suspended in a sauce that showed no visible tomato.    The Parmesan cheese was grated, as it should be, directly onto the plate. But my companion's tagliatelle al ragu -- plain egg noodles with the same meat sauce and plenty of Parmesan -- was, in its bold simplicity, even better than the lasagne.   The decor of Dal Bolognese is classic and clubby, and the address, on historic, high-rent Piazza del Popolo, tells you right off to expect customers as rich as the food.    On a recent Sunday at lunch -- the most hectic meal of the week in Italy -- the place was full of show people and cashmere-and-pearls perfect families, clearly regulars.   In such circumstances, in Rome, faces not known from either the neighborhood or the screen are often ignored. But the service was professional beyond the call of duty.    No sooner had my snobbish Italian companion raised one eyebrow to make a crack about how Americans would enjoy the sparkling Lambrusco, than our waiter was at his elbow offering to change the wine if he didn't like it.   We kept the Lambrusco, a light, regional red, to accompany his gran bollito misto, the restaurant's -- and the region's -- piece de resistance, and what practically everybody there was eating. This assortment of boiled meats is served from a special cart (carrello) that keeps them warm in their various broths.    The meats are presented with, as condiments, tubs of green sauce and \"mostarda,\" a fascinating fruit preserve typical, in many variations, of the northern regions of Italy.   The meats include (in the proportions the diner requests) beef, tongue, fowl, cotechino sausage, and, by rights, veal head, but when my companion asked for the latter, all that was left was a bit of ear.   My polpettone alla bolognese, two slices of a light meatloaf baked around a hard-boiled egg and served with mashed potatoes (pure in Italian) was less of a production but quite nice. The menu includes some cold dishes and simple grilled meats, so that you can get away with eating less than 3,000 calories, but there's no point in ordering anything other than regional specialties.   For antipasto, the best choice is a plate of unadorned culatello di Zibello, a delicate prosciutto-like specialty of Parma considered the aristocrat of Italian cold cuts and uncommon in Rome.   The homemade desserts, after an encounter with the carrello, seemed less appealing than something smooth and slippery, like creme caramel or sorbetto. Il Drappo   Admittedly the idea of a chi-chi Sardinian restaurant gives pause.    The region is one of Italy's poorest and most rugged, and away from the coast, its cuisine is that of the shepherds of the mountainous hinterland, which runs to grilled sheep innards -- definitely not on the menu at Il Drappo.    But the owner-chefs, Paolo and Valentina Tonu, are Sardinian brother and sister and the menu is built around island ingredients and themes, with delicious results.    And the particularly interesting breadbasket contains the typically Sardinian flat, brittle bread known as carta da musica (music paper).   The system at Il Drappo is the fixed-price meal, beginning with an antipasto of diced tomatoes on crunchy thin bread (you have to use both fork and fingers) plus tiny pizzas and some other tidbit, which on our recent visit was fritters with salady stuff inside.    The wine is the house Sardinian red or white.   The first courses change frequently but always offer at least one soup (lentil at our recent dinner) and an ample choice of pastas, usually with seafood or vegetarian sauces. We tried fettuccine with cozze (mussels) and vongole (clams) in a light, but very piquant, tomato sauce; spaghetti with chicory and bottarga (dried mullet roe), and spaghetti in a sauce of nero di seppia (cuttlefish ink).    All were wonderful, but the spaghetti with bottarga -- a specialty of Sardinia -- was sublime.   The main course offerings always include both meat and fish, usually in labor-intensive preparations, a welcome change in Rome. Our roast baby pork (maialino), however, was quite simple and classically Sardinian; the peppers stuffed with artichokes were less orthodox and more typically Drappo.   On another occasion, we enjoyed the grilled, stuffed squid, though the meatballs were a bit boring (both were offered on our most recent visit).   Dessert is seadas, dough filled with white cheese, then fried and topped with bitter honey. It's typically Sardinian, and very good. A chilled glass of Sardinian grappa or the much tamer bilberry liqueur called \"mirto\" finishes the meal.   Some people find the decor -- billowing draperies on the ceiling, Sardinian cork in the place of wood paneling -- too precious, but the waiter, Mario Bergantilli, manages to convey the true spirit of the place: the only thing you should take seriously is cleaning your plate. Tavola d'Oro   The only full-fledged Sicilian restaurant in Rome (though a handful of others serve Sicilian dishes) is a hole in the wall that becomes unbearably smoky and unmanageable when crowded, which is usually.   But a friend and I were there when it opened at 7:30 one recent evening, and enjoyed reasonable service, including the attention of the proprietor, Elisabetta Esposito.   In any case, one doesn't go there for the ambiance; one goes in spite of it, for the food.   Caponata, that wonderful Sicilian concoction based on eggplant, tomato, onion, and celery, is easier to find in New York than in Rome, so our antipasto Siciliano -- caponata, marinated zucchini, black and green olives, and roasted sweet peppers -- was sheer bliss.   The pasta offerings include the archetypal Sicilian preparation -- called alla Norma, after Bellini's opera -- with a tomato and eggplant sauce over little shells and ricotta salata grated on top; bucatini with sardines (also de rigueur); and short pasta, like penne, with broccoli (actually the pale-green cross between the cauliflower and broccoli appearing in American markets as \"broccoflower\") and caciocavallo cheese.   The most interesting main dishes are involtini (roll-ups) of eggplant stuffed with ground meat and the typical bistecca alla palermitana, a breaded veal cutlet baked, not fried, and large enough to share. The crespelle -- great hulking fritters, one filled with ricotta and the other with anchovies -- were too heavy.   Anyone who is able to continue can finish with a ricotta-filled cannolo -- the Sicilian dessert par excellence. Al Brigante Crocco    About 10 minutes' taxi ride from the center of town is a restaurant representing Italy's most depressed region, Basilicata, or Lucania (an archaic name), which is in the middle of the south, between Puglia on the east and Campania and Calabria on the west.    The region has almost no seacoast, and the dominant flavors of Basilicata are animal, dairy and vegetable.   This restaurant, whimsically named for a 19th-century brigand, is a cozy little spot that makes some effort to evoke its origins in its decor, which includes pottery dishes and hanging antique pistols.   The menu is strongest in the early courses. The antipasto consists of a plate of salamis and a plate of marinated eggplant, olives, mushrooms and the exotic lampascione, which looks like a small onion but has a bitter taste all its own. There was a good mushroom and potato soup on recent visit, but the homemade pastas, orecchiette (\"little ears\") and strascinati (flat disks of pasta about the size of a 50-cent piece), are the whole point of going to a Lucanian restaurant.   We found the orecchiette con cime di rape (broccoletti in Rome, broccoli rape in New York) a bit thin and flat (but then I found it insipid homemade in Basilicata too), especially in comparison with Tavola d'Oro's richer version. But there was nothing insipid about the superb strascinati with a strong tomato sauce, eggplant, and pecorino cheese. The rabbit with olives and the meatballs were uninteresting; neither satisfied the urge for the exotic that had taken us to the restaurant in the first place.    We might have done better with the baked baccala (salt cod), the only fish on the menu.    The carafe wine, an Aglianico (the inevitable red of Basilicata), was terrible. We eventually asked for a bottle (also Aglianico), which was decent, but we were charged for both.   The restaurant seats 45, which was about 35 more than it could handle on a Saturday night.
