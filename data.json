Leonard Slatkin, who conducted the New York Philharmonic's New Year's Eve concert on Thursday evening, has been toying with that tradition lately.   When he led the Philharmonic New Year's Eve concert last year, he moved the waltzes and polkas to the second half of the program and devoted the first half to Saint-Saens's \"Carnival of the Animals,\" with an amusing new narration by Peter Schickele. This year, Mr. Slatkin pushed his renovation forward. The Viennese bonbons kept their grip on the second half. But on the theory that the Viennese works are so entrenched because they combine dance rhythms and are often descriptive novelty pieces, Mr. Slatkin sought equivalents in the American symphonic repertory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930102","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/02/sports/results-plus-365593.html","abstract":"  HORSE RACING Very Crafty, Indeed Ridden by Richard Migliore, Win Crafty Lady scored a pace-setting, one-length victory over Wood So in the $100,000 Interborough Breeders' Cup at Aqueduct yesterday.

The book took the architectural salons by storm, became something of a cult classic and sent the careers of all five men hurtling forward.    These architects eventually moved in quite different directions, but not for some years; for most of the 1970's they were so closely identified with one another, and with New York, that they were known internationally both as the New York School and as \"The Five.\" (In Italy, they were called \"I Five di New York.\")","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930103","headline":"Louise Metcalf, John Wellemeyer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/03/style/weddings-louise-metcalf-john-wellemeyer.html","abstract":"  Louise Anne Metcalf, a recruitment manager for the Laurentian-Milldon Company, an insurance company in London, was married yesterday to John Charles Wellemeyer, a managing director in London for Morgan Stanley & Company, the investment bank.

And in an Embratur survey of foreign tourists taken in 1990, about a third said crime was the main reason for the decline in tourism to Rio.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930103","headline":"Go West, Young Doctor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/03/books/go-west-young-doctor.html","abstract":"SHAMAN\n\nBy Noah Gordon.\n519 pp. New York: Dutton. $23.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930103","headline":"Old Money, New Blood","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/03/style/old-money-new-blood.html","abstract":"RACHEL PETERS\n\nAge: 22.

It was sad to watch Lester and Bullock, et. al., invite arrest -- the summonses, by the way, were prewritten, thanks to advance agreement with the Department of Environmental Conservation, and shocking to see D.E.C. officials, again by prescribed agreement, actually stand and watch rehearsed criminal activity without doing a thing to prevent it. Aren't public officials supposed to observe the law? The day of infamy on Indian Wells Beach was clearly a publicity stunt. The real beneficiaries, obviously, are Mr. Joel and his record company and Mr. Bullock, who apparently chose arrest as welcome relief from his other duties, which evidently consist mainly of arranging to appear in Dan's Papers with melanoma-bent \"guests\" of the female persuasion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930103","headline":"Susan R.

The answer is, 'How can we not afford it?' \"\nParental Support Cited\n\n If schools are in a severe budget crisis, \"it is a great time to plan,\" Mr. Reilly said. \"Build consensus within the district to do something. The teachers, administrators, board, P.T.A. -- everybody has to feel that commitment.\"\n\nMr. Reilly said planning has to include wiring. Putting computers in the library is a start, but the ultimate, he added, is to have the information in the classroom. Connect the classroom to the library, he said.\n\nA good example is the Greenville School in the Edgemont district, which as part of a pilot project with International Business Machines and the State Education Department received $500,000 in equipment and training and plans to put four or five computers in each of its 18 classrooms. The district invested $35,000 to rewire its school to connect computers to each other and to library equipment. Dr. Jerry Schulman, the principal, said the district has learned how to proceed in other schools.\n\nDeborah L. Squire, chairwoman of the library media department at Pelham Middle School/High School, said it would be difficult to estimate her district's costs because changes were made piecemeal and the district had some Federal grant money.\n\n\"What we have done the parents have supported,\" she said. Whenever she has gone before the school board with proposals, there has always been \"at least one parent in the audience who has stood up and said: 'This is very important. This is what we do in the real world.' \"\n\nAmy Botto, computer chairwoman of the Mahopac School District for the last 12 years, said it took many years to bring computer networks to some of their classrooms. \"A lot of it is through grants, pilot programs, Boces and spending money wisely,\" she said. She has sought out companies to install equipment at their expense as pilot projects. \"Other schools want to see how it works before they make the investment,\" she said.\nTeacher Training Called Essential\n\n Teacher education is a major part of planning. The Southern Westchester Boces and the Putnam/Northern Westchester Boces have computer education and resource programs.\n\nA major corporate effort to improve technology is an alliance of nine Westchester colleges with teacher-training programs to educate college faculty about the new technology and other areas of change. The program, called the Westchester Teacher Education Group, is coordinated by the Westchester Education Coalition, a public-private partnership, financed by a $900,000 grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Westchester Fund. I.B.M. has also donated $100,000 in equipment and support.\n\nAnother aspect of adopting new technology is preparing teachers to use computers while they are still in training. Nine Westchester colleges are working together in a four-year program, coordinated by the Westchester Education Coalition, a public-private partnership, to integrate computer technology into teacher-training programs. The program, called the Westchester Teacher Education Group, is being financed by a $900,000 grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Westchester Fund. I.B.M. has also donated $100,000 in equipment and support.\n\n\"It really takes time,\" Dr. Freeouf said. \"It is not a quick fix.\" She said that businesses and schools are approaching technology education from different perspectives. \"People from businesses want the instantaneous cost effectiveness, but schools are different from workplaces, where they use one software. One of the differences between education and business is that we are looking at different kinds of projects and different kinds of processes. Schools are preparing kids for unknown worlds now.\"\n\n\nINA ARONOW","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930103","headline":"The High Art of Organizing Your Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/03/style/foraging-the-high-art-of-organizing-your-life.html","abstract":"  OF all the New Year's resolutions, getting organized may be second in popularity only to losing 10 pounds, and with the right personal organizer, it may be a lot easier.

Increasingly distant from its roots, swallowed by ever-expanding media conglomerates, upstaged by video imagery and marketed with unrelenting repetition, rock could easily have become as glittery, superficial and disposable as other American consumer products. But despite -- and sometimes because of -- those changes, as 1993 begins, it is clear that the early 1990's have brought better popular music than anyone might have expected.   Rock of the 1990's is shaping up as a polymorphous mess -- dozens of categories and subgenres and recombinations -- with a core of genuine innovation and surprising seriousness. While shallow commercial pop and lovers' ballads will never disappear, they're not alone amid the gold and platinum albums; alongside them is music that takes chances and overhauls conventions to speak from the heart. The best 1990's rock (a term I'll use to encompass hip-hop, dance music and the rest of the mess) often rejects prettiness, but it has the severe beauty of passion inventing its own structures. It also has the kind of visceral kick that puts bodies in motion and demands a reaction, the way rock should.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930103","headline":"Amy Mazzola, Tad Flynn","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/03/style/engagements-amy-mazzola-tad-flynn.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. John W.

At year's end, prospects for all three have plummeted. In early 1992, hardly anyone gave a thought to Bosnia or Somalia. Within months, they were called sites of genocide and ignited dramatic debates about using force for humanitarian ends. In January 1992, few Americans recognized the Arkansas Governor's name. Ten months later, Bill Clinton was elected President.   Events sometimes confound us because of honest miscalculation or wishful thinking. Judgments counter judgments, and hope clouds history. Such all-too-human ways explain our failure to look hard enough at obvious historical hurdles.

Wisely, Michael Olmert, in THE SMITHSONIAN BOOK OF BOOKS (Smithsonian, $45), does not try. He provides, instead, an amiable summary of some of the more remarkable events in the history of the written word, beginning with the earliest examples of writing (produced in the Middle East, in the fourth millennium B.C., on clay tablets) and concluding with the profound impact of computer technology on publishing and reading. \"The book as we know it,\" Mr. Olmert notes, \"is pushing its 2,000th birthday,\" having taken its present form in Rome when someone first folded sheets of papyrus into a semblance of pages. For much of its history the book has been a handmade object, often a work of art, as many of the reproductions here demonstrate -- of early Middle Eastern and Far Eastern religious texts, glowing pages from the Irish Book of Kells and majestic 15th-century Bibles, including Gutenberg's 1455 masterwork. Mr. Olmert, a magazine journalist, is particularly fascinating in describing the impact of the printing press in Europe, the lives of the first printers and designers and the phenomenal growth of the industry: between 1455 and 1500 a staggering 10 million copies of books were printed. But finally the book is most affecting not in its summaries but in its incidentals, such as the wonderful description by James Boswell of Samuel Johnson, sitting at the dinner table with a book \"wrapped in the table-cloth . . . from an avidity to have one entertainment in readiness, when he should have finished another.\" It is an image that any fervid reader can identify with.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930103","headline":"New Jersey Q & A: Ciro A.

The name stuck, and ever since historians have used the word Hadley to describe the wide-board oak chests and other boxy furniture decorated, as was Erving's, with a tulip-and-leaf motif. Although the botanical image was the most favored at the time, other patterns appeared on Hadley furnishings, which were produced along the Connecticut River between 1690 and 1740.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930103","headline":"Robinson Is Reported As the Choice at U.S.C.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/03/sports/sports-people-college-football-robinson-is-reported-as-the-choice-at-usc.html","abstract":"  JOHN ROBINSON is returning to his old job as football coach at Southern California and has agreed to a multiyear contract, The Orange County Register reported yesterday.

A1 NOSTALGIA FOR THE OLD ORDER   News analysis: The signing of the Start II treaty was a poignant final adventure in George Bush's Presidency. Adding to the nostalgia was a sense that the world is more volatile than it was during the cold war.  A1 President-elect Clinton welcomes an early meeting with Mr. Yeltsin.  A9 America invades Moscow with fast food and videocassettes.  A8 SOMALI CROWD ATTACKS U.N.   Rock-throwing protesters besieged the United Nations compound in Somalia's capital. It was the second country in a week to protest the arrival of Secretary General Boutros-Ghali on a peace mission.  A1 The Marines leisurely came to the rescue of the U.N. leader.  A6 Somalia's warring factions are to open talks today in Ethiopia.  A6 The U.N. will pull aid workers from a port where one was killed.  A6 SHELLS ISOLATE 400 PALESTINIANS   Shells landed near tents in southern Lebanon where about 400 Palestinians are living after being expelled by Israel. The Palestinians said Israelis were trying to prevent people from bringing them food.  A2 An Israeli intelligence agent was slain in Jerusalem.  A2 WITH A MAP, BOSNIAN FOES MEET   Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Serbian nationalists who have seized two-thirds of Bosnia, met in Geneva with Bosnia's Muslim President, Alija Izetbegovic.

A1 NAVIGATING THE TV DIAL   Plans by a cable television company to expand its systems tenfold in some cities provoked the lament, \"500 channels and nothing on.\" But a more fundamental problem remains: how would anyone know? Simply figuring out what's on television is becoming skilled labor.  A1 COURT TEST FOR THE PRESS   The case of a reporter and an abused child is headed for the Supreme Court, possibly leading to a major First Amendment decision.  A10 NUTS AND BOLTS OF INAUGURATION   Apart from the lofty issues of symbolism and politics involved in an inauguration, vendors are consumed with practical problems like how to connect electrical systems and how high to build bleachers, in addition to how to make money.  A12 CONFIRMATION HEARINGS SET   Senate committees will start conducting informal confirmation hearings of Clinton's Cabinet selections this week.  A12 SNOW SHUTS DOWN RESORT TOWN   Tahoe City Journal: Vacationers and merchants dug out from one of the worst winter storms to hit the Sierra Nevadas in a decade.
