Mr. Watson, known as a saxophonist and composer, had big-band aspirations, not a fruitful thing to have, given jazz's generally enfeebled economic situation. The concert, often brilliant, looked as if it was set to go down in legend, a one-time event making Mr. Watson one of those rare jazz composers lucky enough to hear their music played by a large ensemble, if only for one night. With big bands seemingly relegated to the dustbin of history, the music was destined for the security of Mr. Watson's desk drawer.   But the current jazz renaissance has had all sorts of salutary effects, not the least of which is a flowering, albeit small, of interest in big-band music among both audiences and musicians. Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall both have jazz orchestras; Jimmy Heath and Slide Hampton have started large ensembles recently, and Wynton Marsalis moves closer to fronting a big band every year. Illinois Jacquet's orchestra was one of the highlights of the 1980's, and the American Jazz Orchestra, David Murray's big band and Clifford Jordan's orchestra have all offered exceptional music.

This week's prime exhibit is \"Murder in the Heartland,\" a four-hour, two-part movie being broadcast at 9 P.M. on ABC tonight and tomorrow. This is the story of Charles Starkweather, a 19-year-old psychopath who in 1958 killed 11 people in Nebraska. As ABC puts it, virtually salivating, it was \"one of the most sensational murder rampages in American history.\" In short, perfect for television entertainment.    Thinly fictionalized, the Starkweather story was the inspiration for the 1973 Terrence Malick film \"Badlands,\" which, like \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" is one of those gorgeously produced but fuzzy movie exercises elevating thugs into national myths. \"Murder in the Heartland\" isn't even that ambitious, though there are allusions to the story's Eisenhower era and, apparently, a kind of sociocultural repression ready to explode. Police officers are depicted, for the most part, as morons.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"A Breakthrough on Bosnia?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/opinion/a-breakthrough-on-bosnia.html","abstract":"  President Clinton's escalation of pressure on the Serbs to make peace in Bosnia appears to be yielding encouraging results. In the most hopeful sign in months, the recalcitrant leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, has signed the international peace plan designed to end fighting in the Balkans.    If the Serbs really mean to halt their genocidal onslaught, this is indeed a diplomatic triumph. Under the peace plan approved yesterday in Greece, the Bosnian Serbs would be forced to yield roughly a third of the territory they have seized and would be denied the corridors they seek to link Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia proper.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"For Yankees, Victory Is a Walk in the Park","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/sports/baseball-for-yankees-victory-is-a-walk-in-the-park.html","abstract":"  Here was the classic Little League confrontation at Yankee Stadium: a shy batter, reluctant to swing at intimidating pitches with the bases loaded, the score tied and two outs in an extra inning.   \"It was the first time in my life I've seen a hitter get up with the bases loaded in the last inning with no intention of swinging the bat,\" said Norm Charlton, the bully, the Seattle pitcher.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"A Key Question: Whose General?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/world/a-key-question-whose-general.html","abstract":"  For decades, the United States has resisted putting American forces under the command of a foreign general.

Ms. Rivera plays the title role, a B-movie queen in a Louise Brooks bob who stars in the celluloid reruns that Molina conjures to pass the time of his incarceration. This means that she gets to pop on stage every scene or two in musical parodies of 1940's movie schlock (music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb) and to wear costumes that include a scanty, yellow feathered jungle skirt and headdress, a czarina's silk gown and, most persistently, a horror picture's spider bodysuit befitting her status as the evening's symbolic angel of death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930504","headline":"Observer; A Case Of Eerie Leakage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/opinion/observer-a-case-of-eerie-leakage.html","abstract":"  Does anybody else here have leaking TV cable?

The move virtually insures that Mr. McCall will become the first black person to hold a statewide elective office in New York. A1. Despite losing on votes, a reputation for the middle road. B8. Another blow to Mayor Dinkins's power on the Board of Education. B8. NEW YORK CITY A HOLDING BUDGET IN AN ELECTION YEAR   Mayor Dinkins releases a $31.4 billion budget for the next fiscal year, one that relies on modest spending cuts and promises of state and Federal aid to close a $2.1 billion gap. The strategy enables him to avoid layoffs or large cuts in city services during the year that he is up for re-election. A1. SIX KILLED, THEN SET ON FIRE   Six people, including a baby, were beaten, stabbed and strangled in their East Harlem public housing apartment. Then the place was set on fire, apparently in an attempt to conceal the crime. A1.  ASSAULT CHARGES DISMISSED   A judge dismissed assault charges against a Hasidic Jew who was accused of being part of a group who beat a black man, Ralph Nimmons, last year in Crown Heights. Mr. Nimmons, who said he was the victim of a racial attack, has refused to cooperate with prosecutors. B3.  BOESKY V. BOESKY, OVER MONEY   The divorce trial of Ivan F. Boesky, arbitrageur and ex-convict, and his wife, Seema, is under way, as anonymously as the participants can keep it. At issue is how to divide Mrs. Boesky's assets, which are estimated at $100 million. B3.   In what police call a possible bias crime, tires are slashed in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. B2.   The doctor who headed the Connecticut investigation into whether Woody Allen molested his daughter, Dylan, theorized that the child either invented the story or that it was planted in her mind by her mother, Mia Farrow. B5. REGION FLORIO AIDE IN BOND INQUIRY   Merrill Lynch & Company has suspended three senior executives involved in municipal bond transactions with a company tied to Joseph C. Salema, chief of staff to Governor Florio.  The company says its internal inquiry prompted the Federal investigation into the possibility that brides were paid to steer nearly $3 billion in New Jersey Turnpike bond business. A1. TRUMP SUES ON INDIAN CASINOS   Donald Trump, who owns three casinos in Atlantic City, has sued the Federal Government, maintaining that allowing Indian tribes to open casinos discriminates against him. The lawsuit, filed in Newark, argues that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is unconstitutional. B6. Lawyers deliver their closing arguments in the fraud trial of Armand P. D'Amato. B6.

The year is 1985. It is 15 years until the next millennium. And a young man drenched in death fevers in his Greenwich Village bedroom hears a persistent throbbing, a thunderous heartbeat, as if the heavens were about to give birth to a miracle so that he might be born again.   This is the astonishing theatrical landscape, intimate and epic, of Tony Kushner's \"Angels in America,\" which made its much-awaited Broadway debut at the Walter Kerr Theater last night. This play has already been talked about so much that you may feel you have already seen it, but believe me, you haven't, even if you actually have. The new New York production is the third I've seen of \"Millennium Approaches,\" as the first, self-contained, three-and-a-half- hour part of \"Angels in America\" is titled. (Part 2, \"Perestroika,\" is to join it in repertory in the fall.) As directed with crystalline lucidity by George C. Wolfe and ignited by blood-churning performances by Ron Leibman and Stephen Spinella, this staging only adds to the impression that Mr. Kushner has written the most thrilling American play in years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930505","headline":"Leslie Gelb Will Direct Foreign Affairs Group","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/05/world/leslie-gelb-will-direct-foreign-affairs-group.html","abstract":"  Leslie H.

Miller, who had played a mere 14 playoff minutes before tonight and was inserted simply to throw his beef around, converted two important free throws in the final minute and then corraled a huge rebound with 26 seconds left. That seemed to secure the Suns' victory, but Dan Majerle, whose free throws are usually automatic, badly missed two foul shots with a 103-100 lead.
