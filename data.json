And they are crisscross-laced with about a dozen flat-wound, cotton athletic shoestrings, in sky blue, purple, argyle or gold, tied in large, loose, loopy bows. WHERE THEY'RE FOUND: On the 53-year-old feet of George Clinton, the zany godfather of funk music. The foot-stomping, blues-based, rock-and-R-and-B-fused sound has made him the funkiest man on the planet (and sometimes off). And so go his shoes.   The shoes are also featured in the album art of Mr. Clinton's latest recording, \"Hey Man . . . Smell My Finger,\" on Prince's Paisley Park Records. (And Prince is someone else with a fetish for uplifting footwear.) WHAT THEY REALLY, REALLY ARE: Attitude with sole. Like Elvis's (late Vegas period) oversize belt buckle, Louis Armstrong's handkerchief, James Brown's conked kinks and the omnipresent scarf that Aerosmith's Steven Tyler clings to when he sings, Mr. Clinton's shoes, no matter which ones he wears, are a show-biz-hyped distillation and projection of his style. And what a style: from a pair of five-inch-high platform sneakers to feathered, mid-calf-length, hand-stitched trapper boots.   Mr. Clinton, a former hairdresser in Newark who likes to wear his hair these days in a freaked-out, funny fright wig of braids, tresses and coiled multicolored yarn, was recently quoted in Interview magazine as saying, \"I can wear any style -- or have no style -- and it doesn't bother me.\" WHY: Funk feeds the deep nostalgia of inner-city baby boomers and the insatiable hunger of members of the hip-hop generation, who've sampled songs like Mr. Clinton's \"Atomic Dog,\" \"Flash Light\" and \"P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)\" with abandon and reverence. And thus Mr. Clinton is high-stepping the pace of his almost-30-year recording career.   A resurgence of 1970's-era disco and funk music is also sweeping the nation, stirring a storm of interest and dollars in Mr. Clinton's various musical incarnations, including his solo act and his role as leader of the eccentric Parliament-Funkadelic funk mob. Re-releases of early albums are planned, as well as a major Clinton tour, record executives said. ADDITIONAL CLINTON PROPS: Funky eye wear, diapers, United States Army-surplus fatigues, chains, rings, wacky T-shirts, knit caps, broad-brimmed hats, capes, cloaks, face paint and, of course, his concert flying saucer, the Mothership. SHOE-IN: Mr. Clinton's ability to transform the ordinary -- like the pair of boxing shoes -- into a highly personalized statement \"speaks to his strength as an artist,\" said Susan Nininger, the Los Angeles-based costume designer who was the stylist on Mr. Clinton's \"Smell My Finger\" album shot and provided the shoes.   \"I was basically asked to bring the wildest stuff I could find and he would be able to wear it,\" she continued. \"I let my imagination go and meld with his outrageousness, and it worked.\" CLINTON'S STYLE CREDO: \"Colors don't clash; people do,\" from Mr. Clinton's new single, \"Paint the White House Black.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Barbara Nonas, Robert Hunter Jr.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/style/weddings-barbara-nonas-robert-hunter-jr.html","abstract":"  Barbara Nonas, a daughter of Dr. Gerson Nonas of New York and the late Marjorie Crystal Nonas, was married yesterday to Robert Wallace Hunter Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs. Hunter of Sarasota, Fla.

The city is easy to get around, has the most up-to-date technology and infrastructure available in Latin America and is relatively safe for travelers.    On a clear day, the mountains around the city can be a shimmering sight of brown topped with white, as they rise above the modern buildings from a thin brown haze at the edge of the city. But a view of the mountains, particularly in winter, is never guaranteed, since in June, when winter begins in the Southern Hemisphere, the city is often troubled by smog.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Elizabeth Katz And Peter Xilas","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/style/weddings-elizabeth-katz-and-peter-xilas.html","abstract":"  Elizabeth Mindy Katz, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Melvin J.

With a pin-striped Willem Dafoe as the poet and Miranda Richardson as his willful, eccentric first wife, Vivien Haigh-Wood, \"Tom and Viv\" portrays a marriage defined by mutual incomprehension, sadness and not a little rancor.   The film, directed by Brian Gilbert, traces a relationship that began at Oxford during World War I, when Tom met the lively, emotionally unpredictable Viv, the elder of two children of a well-to-do (and well-connected) Edwardian couple. The liaison and its decline -- signaled in 1932 by their separation and culminating with her institutionalization six years later -- form the drama of \"Tom and Viv,\" which is scheduled for release next year.

The contrasting textures, shadings and points of view of the 213 crisp black-and-white photographs arouse much esthetic pleasure. But beyond his delight in form, the photographer seems to have stared at surfaces to capture substances and scrutinized the esthetics of characters for clues about their identities and contexts. Toward the end of the book, Mr. Friedlander, whose previous photography books include \"The Jazz People of New Orleans\" and \"Like a One-Eyed Cat,\" shows complete words and sentences: some graphically advertise the stuff of everyday life (chicken, a shoeshine parlor, books); most express beliefs and yearnings. From a white wall, an elongated black \"Sin\" heckles passers-by; a black-marker diatribe against Ronald Reagan defiles a model's smiling face; messages about love and sex are shouted in spray paint or whispered in tiny scratches.

The work, in which Israeli Jews, Palestinian Moslems, and Americans are given a sort of religious Rorschach test about the patriarch Abraham and his immediate family, includes ritualistic chanting from the Hebrew Scriptures by an Ethiopian Jew, Ephraim Isaac. By tradition, each word in the Hebrew text carries fixed melodic tropes, but Mr. Isaac's chant was unlike any I have heard. Its sinuous ornamentation was marked by strong, irregular accents; the chant was clearly influenced by African and Middle Eastern music.   One preoccupation of Mr. Reich and his wife, Beryl Korot, who created the video portions of \"The Cave,\" is the transformations and interpretations of sacred texts, including such traditional musical settings as Mr. Isaac's. The authors explore how tales are understood and misunderstood by Arabs, Jews and Americans. And while \"The Cave\" does not live up to its promise to illuminate contemporary mythologies -- only the bluntest distinctions can be made in the sound bites coming from the video screens -- its ambition is intriguing. The authors are trying to reveal the continuing life of ancient stories.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"A Sanctuary for 2 Cultures","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/travel/a-sanctuary-for-2-cultures.html","abstract":"DURING the ninth lunar month of the year -- which this year is from Oct. 15 through Nov. 14 -- a small island situated three and a half miles southwest of downtown Singapore becomes a magnet for thousands of Malay and Chinese pilgrims.

At the point where their boat was about to founder, a giant sea turtle appeared and, bearing them on its back, rescued the holy men by transforming itself into an island. Kusu, which means tortoise in Chinese and is known as Pulau Tembakul in Malay, is reputed to be the actual \"corpus\" of that original sea turtle, and has achieved holy status in both Chinese and Malay cultures as a place of good fortune.

Any jazz performer will say that some things about traditional jazz change very little over the years. But there are trends, and even some instruments, whose popularity is cyclical. \n\nJazz organ, for example, had its heyday in the 1950's, faced a dramatic decline and is now on the upswing again, said Trudy Pitts, a jazz organist and pianist. She is one of four organists performing today at an \"All Star Jazz Organ Jam Spectacular\" at the Newark Jazz Festival. The festival ends on Saturday; the first events on its schedule for its opening yesterday were a symposium on women in jazz and a Women's Jazz Band program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Austria's Share of the Danube","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/travel/austria-s-share-of-the-danube.html","abstract":"  I HAVE long associated the Danube with Hungary and especially Budapest, the city so closely defined by the magnificent river that flows through it.

With its spacious front yards, green shade trees and porticoed doorways on respectably sized homes, Tyler seems like the essence of modern Southern gentility. On a recent Sunday afternoon, the manicured lawns are strangely empty; the streets are eerily quiet, and the broad intersections are bereft of traffic. The weather is hot and bright like Indian summer, but most of Tyler seems to be locked away behind closed doors.   In the amphitheater of the public park, though, a small crowd of hippie-generation couples, plus assorted aunts and uncles and cousins, has gathered for what is surely an unusual event by Tyler standards: a free outdoor concert by the Texas singer and songwriter Jimmie Dale Gilmore. But then Mr. Gilmore is not your typical country performer. For years he has been one of Texas's best-kept secrets. An Austin resident in his late 40's, he has only recently begun to emerge into the national spotlight. His show in Tyler is the first stop on a two-month national tour in support of his new album, \"Spinning Around the Sun\" on Elektra. (The tour arrives in New York this week for three shows Tuesday through Thursday at the Ballroom.)","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/books/in-short-nonfiction-288293.html","abstract":"  HUMOR  A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN . . .

Photographs that masquerade as art, acting as grand and self-assured as paintings, or leading a piecemeal, hybrid existence in paintings or sculpture or installations, are right in the center of things, and gallery walls fairly teem with them. This story of photography's incorporation and metamorphosis into art amplifies a recurrent theme of this century: a marginal form -- welded metal, factory-made artifacts, rhythm and blues -- shifts into prominence, even predominance.   \"Photographic: Works of the 60's and 70's,\" at the Zabriskie Gallery through Saturday, assembles examples of the many ways photography has progressed through the halls of art and into its living quarters. A couple of museum shows have presented the subject more comprehensively -- \"Photographic\" has only about three dozen objects -- and some have been more generous to photographers than this show, which deals mainly with artists who experimented with cameras. But several of the pieces here are quite satisfying and instructive, and the show touches enough bases to suggest that when photography took up residence in art's inner sanctum, the look of things shifted in just about every direction at once.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Norah K.

But classical-music elitism was not yet the whipping boy it has lately become, and it was possible in those days to redefine a supposedly elitist repertory as revolutionary and egalitarian, by virtue of its one-player-to-a-part structure.

Six days before the scheduled but still uncertain return of Father Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected leader, the conclusions were the same almost everywhere.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19931025","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/25/nyregion/c-corrections-807693.html","abstract":"  An article on Wednesday about Russia's consideration of military intervention to protect the Georgian Government from rebel attack misstated the year the rebel leader, Zviad K.

Is it possible to survive after raising taxes? New Jersey, meanwhile, seeks a capable governor. We recommend re-electing the one they have.   In 1990, newly installed Gov. Jim Florio put through the biggest tax increase in the state's history, having said in his campaign that he saw no need for any increase. In light of the prevailing anti-tax sentiment, it was a brave move. And it was absolutely necessary for New Jersey, as it has been for other states and for the Federal Government, Republican supply-side nostrums notwithstanding. The added revenue solved the problems at hand -- balancing the budget while boosting school aid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931025","headline":"Essay; Sleazy Senate Inquiry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/25/opinion/essay-sleazy-senate-inquiry.html","abstract":"  In a cynical attempt to make Bob Packwood a scapegoat for generations of Congressional sexism, the Senate Ethics Committee put Americans on notice: no private diary is safe from government investigators.

Dennis Russell Davies's work in New York almost always does, so it was paradox that the refreshment of Thursday's program (which will be repeated tonight) at the New York Philharmonic lay in a return to tradition. In Beethoven's \"Pastoral\" Symphony, Mr. Davies reminded listeners that classical style is founded on the dance. Movement was buoyant and accents firm. I found the \"Country Gathering\" uncomfortably fast and the finale's great wall of F-major climax more loud than triumphant, but everywhere, Mr. Davies was reassuring us that his way with modern music grows from a solid grasp of the past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931026","headline":"On My Mind; On Civil Respect","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/opinion/on-my-mind-on-civil-respect.html","abstract":"  In the end, the mayoralty election in New York City will depend on how many New Yorkers vote for civil respect as their first priority.

The movement of water through plants, it seemed, was simple: up into the roots and out through the leaves as vapor. But now they are discovering that plants are not the passive water vaporizers they had been thought to be. Instead, researchers have found an unsuspected detour in the routing of water. And this discovery may enhance the understanding not only of how plants interact with one another but how ecosystems function and even how climate can change.    It turns out that in the night, many plants pull water up from deep in the earth and, rather than holding on to it to pass through their leaves the next day, they flush it out through their shallow roots into the ground around them. Biologists say that plants ranging from sagebrush in the arid steppes of Utah to sugar maples in the rainy forests of upstate New York appear to be acting as subterranean watering systems, drenching the soil and their thirsty neighbors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19931026","headline":"1943: Japanese Base Hit : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/opinion/IHT-1943-japanese-base-hit-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"ALLIED HEADQUARTERS IN AUSTRALIA - [From our New York edition:] Allied heavy and medium bombers and fighters destroyed at least 123 enemy planes, and probably 188, in the air and on the ground during raids on Saturday [Oct. 23] and on Sunday on three aird","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931026","headline":"Judge Backs School Chief In Dispute With Parents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/judge-backs-school-chief-in-dispute-with-parents.html","abstract":"  Turning aside the arguments of parents who have occupied a Brooklyn elementary school to protest their treatment during the asbestos crisis, a State Supreme Court justice ruled yesterday that a local superintendent acted properly when he closed the crumbling building and transferred its students to nearby schools.
