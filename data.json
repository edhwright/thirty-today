Anderson has a fracture of the navicular bone, a boat-shaped bone in the wrist. The fracture was described as nondisplaced, which means the alignment of the bone was not disturbed and the recovery should not be complicated.

Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $22.     Like his first two books, \"Our House in the Last World\" (1983) and \"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love\" (1989), Oscar Hijuelos's latest novel, \"The 14 Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien,\" is a family saga, one of those commodious, emotionally generous books that immerse us in a well-upholstered fictional world. Once again, we are given a richly colored portrait of immigrant life in the United States; once again we are shown how familial hopes, dreams, yearnings and sadnesses are handed down generation to generation.   Whereas \"Mambo Kings,\" which won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, was an insistently male book, focusing on the sexual and romantic adventures of two Cuban immigrant brothers, \"The 14 Sisters\" is a novel about women, a novel examining the lives and loves of the Montez and O'Brien women.   Though many of its central characters suffer from a lingering melancholy reminiscent of that possessed by Nestor, one of the two brothers in \"The Mambo Kings,\" the book is less concerned with loss and missed opportunities than its predecessor. Death, divorce and illness all take their toll here, but \"The 14 Sisters\" takes a longer view of family life than \"The Mambo Kings,\" and its vision is ultimately more redemptive, concerned in the end, like Gabriel Garcia Marquez's \"Love in the Time of Cholera,\" with the cyclical nature of time, and the enduring possibilities of love.   Moving back and forth in time, \"The 14 Sisters\" begins, more or less, with the story of Nelson O'Brien, a young Irish boy, whose dreams of America are based on the penny novels he has read about Wild Bill Hickok and Jesse James. In time, Nelson emigrates to the United States, settles in a small Pennsylvania town and, in 1898 after the death of his beloved sister Kate, goes to Cuba to take photographs of the Spanish-American War.   There, Nelson meets the beautiful, dreamy 16-year-old Mariela Montez, and for 27 Sundays in a row he pays her court. He tells her about his house in Pennsylvania \"deep in the heart of America, where people could do as they pleased and there was no war,\" and she dreams of a good life with this earnest, sad-eyed man. For their wedding, Nelson gives her a telescope so that she might gaze upon the stars, and he introduces the shy young woman to the unexpected pleasures of his bed.   Their passion is enthusiastic, and almost mythically fecund. In the ensuing years in America, Mariela will have 14 daughters, and finally, after all these girls, a son.   Though we wonder how Mr. Hijuelos will ever be able to keep so many siblings clearly sorted out in his mind, he's able to implant a firm sense of each and every one of them in our imaginations. There's Margarita, the oldest and in many ways the novel's presiding spirit, who makes an early, unfortunate marriage, and spends years regretting her mistake, only to discover, late in life, the joys of love and independence. It is Margarita who will keep the members of this huge, sprawling family in touch with one another, and Margarita who will imagine her parents' lives together, and preserve them, along with the lives of her siblings, through the willful exercise of memory.   After Margarita, there's Isabel, the blond, Irish-looking sister, plump and enamored of food, who will find a husband and a home in Cuba. Maria, the third sister, and the twins, Olga and Jacqueline, are the musically gifted ones -- the family's \"Three Nightingales\" -- who will find fulfilling careers in show business. Then there's the beauteous Helen, appropriately named after a bottle of Helen of Troy Beauty Pomade; plump little Irene; the angry, pensive Sarah, and Patricia, the sister born with a gift for second sight.   Veronica, named after the saint, will live up to her name and marry a homeless man she has helped find shelter. Marta and Carmen will remain homebodies for many years, before finding happiness in California. The promiscuous Violeta will eventually abandon her hectic social life to become a minister's wife. And Gloria will struggle for years with her incestuous love for her brother, Emilio, a handsome, introspective boy who will grow up to become a small-time movie star.   In relating the tangled history of the O'Brien-Montez clan, Mr. Hijuelos moves confidently from one character's story to the next, leaping ahead in time to foreshadow the future, then jumping backward in time to show us the seeds of hope and despair. He subtly reveals the ways in which the sisters' choices echo -- or counterpoint -- the choices of their siblings, and he demonstrates, as well, the ways in which their lives both embody and contradict the dreams of their parents.   Toward the end of the book, Mr. Hijuelos's narrative becomes a little rushed, and his quickening litany of developments in the sisters' lives -- alcoholism, addiction to Valium, subscriptions to spiritist newsletters, affairs with younger men -- can sound suspiciously like an inventory of topics on a talk show. The reader, however, never really minds, so persuasive and generous is his delineation of the family's life. Indeed, one finishes \"The 14 Sisters\" reluctantly, the way one finishes a long letter from a beloved family member, eager for all the news not to end.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930302","headline":"By Design; Shielding the Sheer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/02/style/by-design-shielding-the-sheer.html","abstract":"  The idea behind the new \"see through\" styles is to appear tantalizingly bare but, in truth, to be decently attired.

That was the first Green victory over a Harvard hockey team since 1981.   The Crimson's first-place finish was its sixth in the last eight seasons. The next goal will be to win the league tournament, which will culminate at Lake Placid, N.Y., on March 19 and 20.   Like Harvard, Rensselaer has clinched home ice for the early rounds of the tournament. The other two home teams will be decided this weekend in the final regular-season games among Brown, Clarkson, St. Lawrence, Vermont and Yale.   How important is home ice? ECAC home teams have won more than two-thirds of the tournament games. The event begins next Tuesday.   Brown  The Bears, largely ignored through much of the season while hovering around the .500 mark, have a six-game winning streak, the longest since the 1975-1976 Brown team won 13 in a row in a 23-7 campaign.   This surge has taken Brown past slumping Yale and into third place in the ECAC with two important contests at home ahead, against St. Lawrence on Friday and Clarkson on Saturday.   The big player for Coach Bob Gaudet's squad has been Derek Chauvette, a senior forward from West Warwick, R.I., who is seventh among ECAC scorers with 9 goals and 23 assists. His career assist total, 95, is the second-best in Brown history.   Minnesota-Duluth   Known as Duluth Normal for the first half of its 91 years, this college now has its third Western Association regular-season championship team. The other two big years for the school were in 1984 and 1985.   The McNaughton Cup, larger than the National Hockey League's Stanley Cup, is the Bulldogs' prize after they clung to first place for most of the season.   Another prize is home ice and top-seeding for the W.C.H.A. 10-team tournament, which starts March 12.   The Bulldogs have won six of their last seven games and were 15-1-0 at home. Derek Plante, the center on the first line, was the foremost player as anticipated and he leads the conference in scoring with 27 goals and 42 assists in 29 games. Plante will be the choice of many of the electors for the Hobey Baker Award as the sport's best college performer this season.   But Minnesota-Duluth has not impressed all the voters in The Albany Times Union's weekly poll. The Bulldogs (21-8-1 over all) are ranked fifth after Maine (31-1-2), Michigan (24-5-2), Miami of Ohio (24-7-3) and Boston University (24-7-2). The loss to Dartmouth dropped Harvard (19-3-2) from third to sixth this week.   ECAC Women  Providence, as expected, won the first ECAC women's tournament with a 3-0 victory over New Hampshire. Cammie Granato had the winning goal. She is from Downers Grove, Ill., and is the sister of Tony Granato, the former New York Ranger who is now with the Los Angeles Kings.   Many of the women were first brought to hockey by older brothers. \"It's a story I've heard from other women,\" said Kathy Linstad, the Northeastern coach. \"My brothers stuck me in the goal to have someone to shoot at.\"   Hockey East  There are five regular-season games to be played this week before the tournament begins March 12 at campus sites. All eight teams will participate. Maine, Boston University and New Hampshire have clinched home ice and Lowell or Providence will claim the fourth-seeded spot.   Lowell may have the best of it, meeting seventh-place Merrimack at home on Saturday after the Friars have taken on B.U. the night before at home.   Central Association  Alaska-Fairbanks, which has an impressive 21-10-2 record, will play in the C.C.H.A. tournament as an affiliate member. That will make the event a 12-team affair, and home ice will go to Miami, Michigan, Lake Superior State, Michigan State, Western Michigan and Ferris State.   Iona  The Gaels, seeded third in the ECAC North-South playoffs among Division III teams, will take on Fitchburg State tonight on their home ice, the Playland Ice Casino at Rye, N.Y.   Although its overall record was only 11-10-1, Iona won its last six league games to capture first place in the South division. A freshman, Patrick Lyons from Providence, R.I., was the Gaels' leading scorer, with 31 points in 22 games.   Middlebury (18-3-2) is seeded first in the ECAC East eight-team tournament, which began last night. Middlebury was followed by Babson (17-5-1), Connecticut (18-5-2) and Williams (17-6-0). Semifinals are Friday and the championship game comes Saturday at a site to be determined.   Plattsburgh State  The Cardinals will play host to Cortland State, a team they have beaten twice this season, in the championship game Saturday of the SUNY tournament.    Cortland defeated Fredonia to reach the final, and Plattsburgh crushed Oswego by a combined score of 17-7 in two games as Lenny Pereira stretched his scoring streak to 23 games.   Plattsburgh now awaits the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III tournament, while Elmira plays host to the ECAC West tourney Friday and Saturday. The Soaring Eagles (21-5-0) will play Hobart (14-11-0), and Canisius (17-10-1) will meet Mercyhurst (18-7-0).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930303","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/03/sports/transactions-972593.html","abstract":"  Baseball  American League  MILWAUKEE BREWERS -- Agreed to terms with Doug Henry, pitcher, on a one-year contract.

Stunt programming during a sweeps period -- when ratings that determine advertising rates are measured -- isn't limited to the commercial networks. Public television and cable are not just passive bystanders. They, too, haul out their biggest guns and, more often than not, that means big names. Tonight alone offers \"Sondheim: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall,\" on Channel 13 at 8 in New York and at 8:30 on PBS; \"Larry King Extra: A Very Special Conversation With Elizabeth Taylor,\" on TNT at 8, and \"Maestro Between Two Worlds: Kurt Masur,\" on Channel 31 at 9.    Taped in June before the kind of adoring audience attracted to any Stephen Sondheim event, the Carnegie Hall occasion is not as consistently electrifying as the 1986 \"Follies in Concert\" classic at Lincoln Center. This time, an effort has been made to include some of the composer's lesser-known works, numbers from the stage musical \"Assassins\" and the film \"Dick Tracy.\" That effort is not always justified.    But when Mr. Sondheim is good, he is brilliant. And there are enough stars on hand to make some of his more familiar songs soar: Bernadette Peters with \"Not a Day Goes By,\" Patti LuPone with \"Being Alive,\" Dorothy Loudon with a medley of \"Losing My Mind\" and \"You Could Drive a Person Crazy.\" Glenn Close's dramatic reading of \"Send In the Clowns\" comes off far more effectively in television close-up than from a seat in the middle of Carnegie Hall.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930303","headline":"Campus Journal; For a Black Woman, Space Isn't the Final Frontier","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/03/education/campus-journal-for-a-black-woman-space-isn-t-the-final-frontier.html","abstract":"  As the first black woman to venture into outer space, Dr. Mae C.

The Chilingirian String Quartet closed its concert at Weill Recital Hall on Friday evening with a big, blustery performance of the Bartok quintet, with Panayis Lyras at the piano.

Indeed, listening to the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra under James Levine play it at Carnegie Hall on Sunday afternoon was to be stunned all over again.   Music has not been the same since \"Le Sacre.\" Its legitimization of violent expression and its violations of regular metric movement opened avenues for younger composers, but Stravinsky's piece created no school of followers: nothing, for instance, that approached Schoenberg's influence on a generation of Serialists or Chopin's on the piano writing that came after him. \"Le Sacre\" stands by itself.

Backup Generators Disabled    The explosion on Friday in the World Trade Center's underground garage destroyed the complex's emergency command center, disabled its backup generators in the basement and sent thick smoke up into the two 110-story towers.

They just couldn't agree on how much more. And since as a two-year player, Gonzalez wasn't eligible for arbitration until after this season, it was the Rangers who had the ultimate leverage. Yesterday they used it. After failing to win agreement on a multiyear contract or even an interim one-year deal, the team unilaterally renewed Gonzalez's contract for one year at what team officials described as \"a very substantial raise,\" presumably closer to the $500,000 the club had offered than the $850,000 Gonzalez had sought. Two other players not eligible for arbitration -- catcher Ivan Rodriguez, the American League Gold Glove winner, and third baseman Dean Palmer -- also rejected multiyear pacts but came to terms on new one-year agreements.   Kansas City Royals   In 10 years in the big leagues he had never had surgery, but yesterday Mike Boddicker underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and was expected to miss two to four weeks. A minor cartilage tear was repaired and cartilage under the knee cap was shaved, the Royals' team physician, Steve Joyce, said. Doctors had not expected to have to shave the cartilage, and Boddicker will be out longer than had been thought. The 35-year-old right-hander, 1-4 with a 4.98 earned run average and three saves in 1992, will be paid $3 million this season, the final year of a three-year contract.   Chicago White Sox   A disgruntled Carlton Fisk reported to camp, still stuck with a minor league contract, albeit one fashioned in an unprecedented way. The 45-year-old catcher, the White Sox's career leader in home runs, signed a contract yesterday that had to be drawn up by management's Player Relations Committee in order to include language that Fisk, a 21-year major leaguer, had insisted upon, including a guarantee barring an assignment to Class AAA Nashville. Fisk will be guaranteed $650,000. If the catcher is cut, he will be paid $800,000. If he should play 50 games, his salary would reach $900,000; 90 games would guarantee $1.1 million.   Montreal Expos   Outfielder Moises Alou, who staged a two-hour protest by holding out at the start of spring training, had his 1993 contract renewed yesterday by the Expos, ending an exhausting round of negotiations. Alou, runner-up in National League rookie of the year voting last season, refused to sign for the club's last offer of $210,000, so he was renewed at what he and his agent predicted would be a smaller figure, possibly $200,000.   An impasse centered on the club's belief that Alou receive a split contract, meaning he would be paid a smaller salary if he were sent to the minors. But the club relented and gave him a one-way deal.   Alou followed through on a threat to boycott the start of spring training Feb. 27, holding out for two hours. He then joined workouts after being coaxed by his father, Expos Manager Felipe Alou.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930304","headline":"U.N.

Booker T. Laury, from Memphis, and Henry Townsend, from St. Louis, have been professionals since the 1930's; they are individualists who have stayed that way. Playing solo, they haven't smoothed out individual rhythmic quirks to fit in with bands. And since they have largely been ignored by recording companies -- Mr. Townsend made \"Mule\" for Nighthawk Records in 1980, which has been rereleased as a CD -- they haven't been pressured to update their music. Both bluesmen sound increasingly wayward, startling and irreplaceable.   The 83-year-old Mr. Townsend sang epic-length blues, many stretching far beyond 10 verses, that presented a landscape of unending desolation and betrayal. He sings in a weary, plaintive tenor, with quavers and slides that make remembered pain sound immediate. His gentle vocal lines, and a silently tapping left foot, hold together music that always seems on the verge of shattering.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930304","headline":"Tennis; Rosset Shows Agassi a 3-Set Early Exit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/04/sports/tennis-rosset-shows-agassi-a-3-set-early-exit.html","abstract":"  First came the wonder years, then the half-bald Mohawk years, then the image years, and now, according to 22-year-old Andre Agassi, he has finally entered his professional years.

Sometimes Mr. Roberts will reharmonize a melody, using spare triads at first and fat and lush chords the next. Or he'll arpeggiate through a piece, following the harmonies; standard practice, but with his ability to convey clarity, the most obvious movements become profound, their significance underscored. He lets his hands mark out contrasting rhythms that threaten to tear a piece apart, and he freely varies a tune's tempo. Mr. Roberts has dedicated himself to learning not only the jazz tradition but also the lilting music of the 19th century, and he brings an astonishing richness to his playing.   Above all, he is gaining a rare intellectual rigor; everything he plays seems to have been examined for the meaning it imparts. He opened his first set on Tuesday at the Village Vanguard (178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street), where he will play through the rest of the week, with a series of piano solos that ranged from material by Scott Joplin and Jelly Roll Morton through a standard -- \"Embraceable You\" -- and Duke Ellington's \"Mood Indigo.\" Each piece rambled through all sorts of different harmonies and styles, but where most players take the simplist interpretive routes, usually adding anachronistic modern flourishes to older material, Mr. Roberts has pared the harmonies, adding momentary dissonances like flashes or letting hammered notes resonate quietly. He's an eccentric, without any of the primitivism that eccentricity so often implies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930304","headline":"Iran Reported to Arrest 47,000 Drug Addicts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/04/world/iran-reported-to-arrest-47000-drug-addicts.html","abstract":"  An estimated 60 tons of illegal drugs have been confiscated and 47,000 addicts arrested since last March in Iran's long-running battle against drug use and trafficking, a Teheran daily reported today.
