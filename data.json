So she called the midwife, who told her not to worry.    Two months later, Mrs. Njoku's baby was born dead. The 8-pound 14-ounce boy's heart had stopped beating a day before he was delivered on Jan. 17, 1993. It was the first time during her pregnancy that she was examined by an obstetrician.   If there is a lesson to be learned from Mrs. Njoku's journey through New York's public hospital system, it is that even the most diligent of expectant mothers can be defeated by a medical bureaucracy that sometimes provides only minimal care.

Even if its third act betrays the limits of Puccini's attention span, \"La Rondine\" represents a typically sweet, lyrical and self-indulgent take on Viennese popular style.   It is, in fact, an operetta turned tragic, as if Puccini was as reluctant as ever to let one of his heroines walk away happy. Here she is Magda, who abandons luxurious courtesanship for the love of Ruggero. He is young, respectable and not terribly bright. After two months of sinful bliss on the Mediterranean (during which time he seems never to have asked where Magda came from) Ruggero proposes marriage. Knowing she will have to tell his family the truth, Magda goes back to Rambaldo, her former keeper.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950306","headline":"The Clamor in Mexico: Sullied Name Stirs Salinas","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/06/world/the-clamor-in-mexico-sullied-name-stirs-salinas.html","abstract":"  Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is assured of a place in Mexican history, but the baffling events of the past week make it almost certain that it will not be the place he so desperately tried to attain.

But in concert, where bluesmen used to prove themselves, Mr. Guy has turned into a peculiar amalgam of blues master and showboating celebrity, devoted more to working a crowd than to playing the blues.   On Thursday night at the Academy, he faced a typical current blues audience: overwhelmingly white, largely male and out to party. It's an audience that both appreciates the performer and treats him like a gifted freak or a servant.

It would almost have been possible to catalogue their virtues in advance.    The Vienna showed off its familiar warm string sound, which can make ordinary orchestral legato seem quirky and edgy, along with a melting, penetrating brass sound that burnishes ordinarily blaring climaxes. It also had the sort of proprietary confidence about the repertory that early-music groups usually possess.

Hunter-gatherers who settled along the Jordan River valley managed to domesticate wild progenitors of wheat and barley as early as 9,000 to 10,000 years ago, and thus became, as far as anyone knows, the first farmers anywhere. Perhaps such a lengthened time gap could suggest clues to the circumstances favoring the transition to agriculture, one of the foremost innovations in human culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19950307","headline":"A Japanese Consensus on the Pacific War Still Doesn't Look Close","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/opinion/IHT-a-japanese-consensus-on-the-pacific-war-still-doesnt-look-close.html","abstract":"Confronting its past record in the Pacific war is getting harder for Japan as the 50th anniversary of its defeat in August 1945 approaches.

Brief performances were a preface to cocktails and dinner. Society photographers were busy. The biggest givers paid $10,000 for their tables.   The politics of creativity were being re-enacted once again. Two-party politics, that is, for what are iconoclasts with no temples to pull down, or revolutionaries with no status quo to undermine. Twenty-four years into its life, ensconced in its well-equipped performing space on West 19th Street and with a firm finger on the pulse of what has been our musical counterculture, the Kitchen has fewer rough edges; defiance seems somewhat beside the point.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950307","headline":"U.S. Envoy Calls, but Croatia Seems Firm on U.N.

Here was music old and new, famous and unknown, delivered with conscientious passion. An unusual cello-heavy instrumentation in three works took advantage of the society's diverse membership, while Dawn Upshaw added an aristocratic vocal gleam.   The new piece was John Harbison's \"Between Two Worlds,\" for soprano, two cellos and two pianos.  Like much of Mr. Harbison's music, this cyclic setting of poems by Robert Bly and religious meditations by Jacob Boehme gracefully blended a sprawling array of styles, influences and ethnic echoes. There were traces of African rhythm, monodic lines out of chant, repetitive figures faintly redolent of Minimalism, flashes of Messiaenesque piano writing and fluid atonal progressions in the Bergian manner, which generally serves as Mr. Harbison's home base.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950307","headline":"Science Times E-Mail","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/science/science-times-e-mail.html","abstract":"  Science Times has an electronic mail address for comments from readers about published articles and suggested areas of coverage:   scitimes@nytimes.com.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19950307","headline":"Christie Is Out of Indoor Championships","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/sports/sports-people-track-and-field-christie-is-out-of-indoor-championships.html","abstract":"  The world indoor championships, already missing many top stars, lost another marquee name yesterday when LINFORD CHRISTIE, the world and Olympic sprint champion, withdrew.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950307","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/nyregion/metro-digest-701695.html","abstract":"  STATE SENATE PASSES DEATH PENALTY   The State Senate voted overwhelmingly to return the death penalty to New York State 18 years after the state's last capital punishment law was declared unconstitutional. At 1 this morning, the Assembly was still locked in a sometimes fiery debate that had begun late Monday afternoon. A1. IN CITY HOSPITALS, CHAOTIC BUREAUCRACY   When New York City's public hospitals underwent their last major reorganization more than 25 years ago, civic leaders renewed a longstanding promise to bring medical care for the poor up to the standards of the best private hospitals. The system that emerged is now under attack for both its ideology and its cost. But long before the change in political sentiment, New York's public hospitals were moving toward a crisis of their own making, with problems that had a familiar ring. A1. ALLEGATIONS OF CO-OP FRAUD   Year after year, the retirees and working-class families who live in the Big Six Towers cooperative in Queens dutifully paid their monthly maintenance fees. And with the promise of great earnings, many even invested their life savings in a plan to expand Big Six's shopping center. But the stunned residents of the Big Six have now learned that they may never recover their investments. A1. NEW YORK CITY  COUNCIL ASSAILS MAYOR ON HOSPITALS   Several City Council leaders assailed Mayor Giuliani's philosophy on hospital privatization, attacking the Mayor's contention that a high death rate among newborn babies in New York City public hospitals demonstrated the need for the city to sell some hospitals. B3.   A woman whose bound and gagged body was found in the basement of a burning house in Queens was identified as a 20-year-old college student from Canarsie, Brooklyn. B3.  REGION  PATAKI GETS A GRADE   At a time in his term when many politicians are still enjoying a honeymoon with voters, Governor Pataki's favorable ratings are barely higher than those of Governor Cuomo at the lowest point of his administration. B5. D'AMATO TO SUPPORT DOLE IN '96   Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato plans to announce his support for Senator Bob Dole's 1996 Presidential campaign, a move that is expected to trigger a chain reaction of endorsements for Mr. Dole by New York Republicans. B5. ECONOMIC PLAN FOR NEW JERSEY CITIES   On a hill where rioters tore the heart out of New Jersey's capital city in 1968, Governor Whitman announced a new urban agenda that offers the cities of New Jersey help in planning for economic recovery, but not much help in paying for it. B6. NICOTINE REPORT WINS JOURNALISM AWARD   Reports on subjects ranging from the nicotine content of cigarettes to fraud at the Immigration and Naturalization Service have won the George Polk Awards for 1994. B6. VANDALS PAINT SWASTIKAS IN L.I.

But on Sunday afternoon at Avery Fisher Hall, Mr. Spivakov and his pianist, Sergei Bezrodny, offered a view of Mozart's Sonata in G (K. 379) -- or at least, its Adagio -- that had a late Beethovenian expansiveness. Its opening piano chords were not merely rolled but were also suffused with dramatic portent, an effect that Mr. Spivakov turned to his advantage at the violin line's entrance.    Throughout the Adagio, Mr. Spivakov played with a rich, centered tone and a focused, thoughtfully regulated vibrato. The Allegro and the closing variations were slightly leaner and more conventionally Mozartean, although Mr. Spivakov's singing tone, the breadth of his coloristic palette and his interaction with Mr. Bezrodny remained the reading's principal attractions. Similar charms enlivened the extroverted reading of Schubert's Fantasie in C (D. 934), which closed the program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19950307","time":"1995-03-07

Reeves was out of town when Meggett left. But he stayed in close contact with Giants management virtually every day he was away. When he got back, Reeves was surprised to hear about some of the things Meggett had said of him and responded to them yesterday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950308","headline":"Foreign Affairs; Mexican Malfunction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/08/opinion/foreign-affairs-mexican-malfunction.html","abstract":"  As my flight into Mexico City was landing, I began to feverishly fill out the customs form they passed out on the plane. Line three, though, stumped me. It consisted of nine different boxes, out of which you were supposed to find and circle your occupation. Columnist wasn't listed. There was, however, \"farmer,\" \"driver of a vehicle,\" \"livestock raiser\" and then one that just leapt out at me. It said: \"bond holder.\"   Those two words tell you a lot about what's wrong with Mexico today. Mexico is so dependent for its economic growth on foreign investors who will buy its government and commercial bonds that \"bond holders\" now have their own box on the visa form. Unfortunately for Mexico, most of the people who check that box are going out, not coming in.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950308","headline":"Sports of The Times; Better Late Than Never For Ashburn","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/08/sports/sports-of-the-times-better-late-than-never-for-ashburn.html","abstract":"  RICHIE ASHBURN invented Marvelous Marv Throneberry, but that is not the reason he was selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame yesterday. Richie Ashburn also threw Cal Abrams out at home to help the Phillies win the 1950 pennant, which is duly remembered by aging Brooklyn Dodgers fans, but that isn't why Ashburn was selected by the Veterans Committee, either.   Ashburn was selected because he was just about as good as a center fielder can be, without bashing the ball over the fence 40 times a year. Not every great center fielder is Willie, Mickey or the Duke, but there should be room in the shrine near the shore of Lake Otesaga for a player who batted .308 over 15 years and ran down most line drives in the power alleys.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950308","headline":"HOUSE APPROVES MEASURE TO LIMIT FEDERAL LAWSUITS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/08/us/house-approves-measure-to-limit-federal-lawsuits.html","abstract":"  Voting largely along party lines, the House of Representatives today passed legislation intended to curtail sharply the increasing number of lawsuits brought in Federal courts.

The main effect of the bill, which was approved 232 to 193, would be to encourage parties to settle lawsuits before trial by exposing them to the risk of paying some of the opponent's legal costs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950308","headline":"A Sport Courting Disaster","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/08/sports/IHT-a-sport-courting-disaster.html","abstract":"Can sport live within the law of the land?
