Back then, he seemed to be teaching the sonatas, presenting them as gems of crystalized musical imagination, set in velvet and examined in a bright, analytical light. Those accounts were by no means passionless, but their principal appeal was intellectual. Now the excitement Mr. Brendel finds in these works is more visceral, more concerned with the gritty, real-life side of Beethoven's music. The velvet has not entirely been cast aside, but the emphasis has shifted from admiring the music to experiencing it.    The works at hand in this installment of Mr. Brendel's three-year Beethoven cycle were the composer's first three sonatas (Op. 2) and his 23d, the \"Appassionata\" (Op. 57). The juxtaposition of the early works, completed in 1795, and the mature \"Appassionata,\" composed a decade later, tells an interesting story of shattered conventions and conceptual expansion. What Mr. Brendel showed, however, was that the seeds of explosive emotionalism that drive the \"Appassionata\" are to be found in the Opus 2 Sonatas, disguised by a veneer of Haydnesque decorousness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940504","headline":"Casino Cheating 101; Police and Other Officials Learn to Spot Those Who Break the Rules of the Game","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/04/nyregion/casino-cheating-101-police-other-officials-learn-spot-those-who-break-rules-game.html","abstract":"  Some people mash the blackjack cards with their rings.

Then he sat down, seemed to leave his nervousness behind, and proceeded with the help of his band to perform three rocking pieces that perfectly blended improvisation and arrangement with jazz and Afro-Cuban musical sources.   Mr. Perez is a smart and gifted pianist, and he has placed himself right at the nexus of several cultural streams. With his band, which includes David Sanchez on saxophones, Larry Grenadier on bass, Ignacio Berroa on drums and Kimati Dinizulu on percussion, he moves easily between the music of the Caribbean and the United States. In Mr. Perez's hands, rhythms constantly shift. And he sends cultural references flying. One minute a boogie-woogie figure spreads shadows over an Afro-Cuban riff, another Mr. Perez muffles the strings inside the piano with his left hand while playing a riff surrounded by a dense and static percussion barrage, only to slide the music gracefully into a deeply swinging section.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940505","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/05/sports/results-plus-994863.html","abstract":"  HORSE RACING Sky Beauty Returns to Winner's Circle  Sky Beauty made a successful return to racing yesterday, scoring a three-length victory over For All Seasons in the $81,425 Grade II Vagrancy Stakes for fillies and mares at Belmont Park.

Still, when Anthony Caro, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski reunited here last week, it was for the first time since they achieved art world stardom during the 1960's. Missing was the group's Brian Epstein, the critic Clement Greenberg, whose guidance and imprimatur had helped to turn them into what they were, for a while. But other cronies were on hand, like the dealer Andre Emmerich and the critic and historian Michael Fried, for a spirited symposium and exhibition at the Hartford Art School.   Depending on one's perspective, the event was a morality tale about art world fickleness or a revival meeting for devotees of high modernism. For the artists, now in their 70's and white-haired, it was a chance to jumpstart an association that had become clouded, Mr. Olitski said, with \"ancient paranoias.\" It was also an opportunity to combine forces once more, this time against what each in turn lambasted as the tyranny of political correctness. Tactfully, no one accused their brand of abstraction -- as determinedly divorced from reference to the real world as so much new art is engaged by it -- with having exercised a similar tyranny three decades ago.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940505","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/05/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-90540377302.html","abstract":"The first time I saw Pamela Harriman, the U.S. ambassador to France, I wanted to form my own impression of a woman said to have lived the exciting sort of life that most only dream about.

The country's territory comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by approximately 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the second highest population density of any country in the world, although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of urban planning. With a multicultural population and in recognition of the cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. English is the lingua franca, with its exclusive use in numerous public services. Multi-racialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19940505","time":"1994-05-05

But on Sunday, at a graduation ceremony, Richard M. Nixon will receive some measure of honor from the university: Duke Law School, from which he graduated third in his class in 1937, will publish in the commencement program a tribute by Dean Pamela Gann.   The memorial salute, which Dean Gann wrote on April 26 to send to Mr. Nixon's family, will serve as an alternative to the moment of silence that was sought in a petition from 105 (not counting the prankster who signed Henry Kissinger's name) of the 190 students graduating from the law school this weekend. An Uneasy History    Four decades ago, shortly after he became Vice President, the university offered Mr. Nixon an honorary degree, then rescinded the gesture because of an uprising by faculty members angered at what they saw as his history of nasty campaigning. Then, in 1961, Mr. Nixon turned the tables, rejecting a degree when the offer was renewed.   And in 1981, seven years after he was forced from the Presidency by the Watergate scandal, the university decided against allowing his Presidential library to be built on campus.    Against that backdrop of strain, the law school's faculty met yesterday to discuss whether to honor the school's most famous alumnus and, if so, how. There was no vote, Dean Gann said in a statement issued later; publication of the tribute was her decision.    \"The law school does not recognize the deaths of faculty, alumni or friends of the law school at its graduation,\" the dean said. \"An exception was made in this case because of the students' request and because President Nixon's death occurred so close in time to the graduation weekend. This particular method was chosen because the in memoriam statement provides a useful summary of Mr. Nixon's associations with the law school and his particular interest in foreign affairs in China, including the special efforts of the Duke Law School in the last 10 years to educate Chinese students about law and legal institutions.\"   Although the issue had not been the hottest one on the Duke campus, Kate Bartlett, senior associate dean of the law school, said some opposition to honoring Mr. Nixon had remained. \"It puts the law school in an awkward position,\" she said, \"where the failures of his life bear directly on our mission: the rule of law and the highest standards of ethics and accountability.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940506","headline":"Baseball; Gallego Goads the Yankees With His Serious Thoughts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/sports/baseball-gallego-goads-the-yankees-with-his-serious-thoughts.html","abstract":"  When Don Mattingly addressed his Yankee teammates last Friday in Oakland because their play had occasionally lacked desire, Mike Gallego was happy to hear the critical words.

In its panic, the Fed has raised interest rates three times, taking everyone by surprise. Long-term bondholders have lost billions and international currency markets have been rattled. Yet the Fed's economists admit they can't point to even a hint of inflation in the current numbers. They are missing the obvious: the 90's are likely to be an inflation-free decade, and their interest rate hikes will squash the current economic recovery.    The 70's and 80's were inflationary times. The failure to raise taxes to pay for the Vietnam War led to slowly accelerating inflation that exploded with the oil and food shocks of the 70's. Inflation stubbornly receded in the 80's.

PLAN FOR AIDS UNIT REVERSED, GROUPS SAY The Giuliani administration, facing a political storm over its plans to shrink or eliminate the Division of AIDS Services, has decided to look for ways to keep the agency intact, AIDS- and homeless-service organizations said after meeting with administration officials. B3. WOMAN ENTERS FIRE DEPARTMENT HISTORY Twelve years ago Rochelle Jones was among the first women to join the Fire Department -- and to face the hostility of male colleagues. Now the women have cause to celebrate. Ms. Jones was promoted to lieutenant, becoming the highest ranking female officer in the department's 129-year history. B3. STRANGLING IS SUSPECTED IN S.I. DEATH A lawyer for the family of a Staten Island man who died in police custody last week said a doctor hired by the family to perform an autopsy suspects that the man was strangled. B3. 4 ACQUITTED OF EXTORTING CONTRACTORS A jury in Brooklyn acquitted four black and Hispanic construction workers charged with extorting money and jobs from construction firms. A fifth was convicted on two counts. B3. A jury awarded $41 million to the family of a woman who sued the Health and Hospitals Corporation and Emergency Medical Services over her death. B7.

In City Center's lavish but bland concert production of the 1941 show \"Lady in the Dark,\" a beautiful but frigid fashion editor named Liza Elliott (Christine Ebersole) rakes through her past for traumas that might explain her inability to make up her mind. The story revolves around three elaborate dream sequences, stuffed with portentous Freudian imagery, that illustrate her repressed sexuality, her indecisiveness and her sense of shame.    \"Lady in the Dark\" revels in high-style Manhattan glamour, 1940's style. Moss Hart's book drips with famous names, chic references and characters gasping \"dahling\" to each other. Kurt Weill's delicious tunes, while retaining vestiges of the acerbic angularity of his German operas, well up with a giddy all-American buoyancy. The lyricist, Ira Gershwin, achieved a racy, Cole Porterish elan with \"The Saga of Jenny,\" Liza's sexy show stopper.

Seeing these films -- on a big screen until June 25, with a Thursday-through-Sunday schedule, or on a video console any time during museum hours -- does not provide the shocking revelation that German film making has been reborn from its doldrums. But many of the films are pretty good; most offer first-rate acting, and all of them provide, for anyone interested in Germany as opposed to German cinema, telling insights into what present-day Germans are fretting about.   Some of the Germans' concerns are specific to them: the reunification of their country and the difficulties that Easterners (\"Ossis\") and Westerners (\"Wessis\") have in comprehending one another; former terrorists coming in from the cold (a special interest of the post-1968 generation that now dominates German film), and the festering problem of neo-Nazi skinheads' violence and the hatred of foreigners.

The campaign involved a mix of politically minded artists and community leaders. In part they wanted big institutions like the Museum of Modern Art to create new departments for black and Puerto Rican artists and in general to be more responsive to a wider range of New York City's population. They also wanted to start community-based museums in poorer sections of the city. (This was a time when the Metropolitan Museum of Art's plans for expansion into Central Park were being strongly opposed by those who thought the museum should disperse its collection through the five boroughs.)   A quarter of a century later much has changed but much has not. Many of the issues are the same. In that time El Museo del Barrio has expanded first into storefronts on Third Avenue and in 1977 into the Heckscher Building at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street, where its role has steadily evolved from a largely Puerto Rican organization to one that represents the art of an increasingly diverse Hispanic population to the rest of the city.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940506","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/style/chronicle-012408.html","abstract":"  A rare ray of happy news from the British royal family.

While legislatures, courts and special commissions dither over whether to sanction doctor-assisted suicide, desperately ill patients are taking matters into their own hands. The jury's eagerness to find any loophole to exonerate Dr. Kevorkian suggests an underlying belief that patients have a \"right to die\" with dignity and to be assisted in their suicides by a willing doctor.   That right got another legal assist this week when a Federal district judge in Seattle ruled that a Washington State ban on assisted suicide was a constitutional infringement on individual liberty. The issue, which is also being contested in the state courts of Michigan, may be headed ultimately to the U.S. Supreme Court.

When Chuck Mangione came to Manhattan from Rochester in the 1960's, he and his brother Gap (Gaspare), a pianist, were leading a hard-bop group called the Jazz Brothers. The two brothers soon went their separate ways. Chuck Mangione played trumpet with Woody Herman, Maynard Ferguson and Art Blakey, and, switching to fluegelhorn, led one of the most popular jazz groups of the 1970's. For his appearance at the Blue Note, his first there in seven years, he will include a special \"Young People's Matinee\" tomorrow to which adults will be admitted only if they are accompanied by someone under 21. Admission is $20, plus a $5 minimum, for shows at 1 and 3:30 P.M. There are also to be the customary evening shows at 9 and 11:30 tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday night, with a $40 music charge at tables or $25 admission to the bar; there is also a $5 minimum at the tables and a one-drink minimum at the bar. Howard Prince Quintet    Howard Prince Quintet, Iridium, 44 West 63d Street, Manhattan (212) 582-2121. A broad range of influences come to bear on the trombonist Howard Prince's playing. These include such trombonists as his idol, J. J. Johnson, and his friend Jimmy Knepper, as well as performances on the bass trumpet in the Wagner \"Ring\" cycle with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. But it is the modal jazz emphasized by his mentor, the pianist and composer George Russell, that is, he says, crucial to his playing. His group, with the pianist Jon Davis, the guitarist Dave Moreno, the bassist Bryce Sebastien and the drummer Victor Jones, is to perform today and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. There is a $10 music charge at the tables or bar.  Carol Sloane    Carol Sloane, Fat Tuesdays, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, Gramercy Park, (212) 533-7900. Carol Sloane's dark and husky voice burst on the jazz world when she was the unheralded star of the 1961 Newport Jazz Festival. Since then she has periodically disappeared from public view for several years and then renewed her singing career with a richer, deeper understanding of her art. She is settled in Massachusetts but makes regular visits to Fat Tuesdays, where she is to perform tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight, and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $20 music charge and a $10 minimum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940506","headline":"Check Your Nerves at the Door","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/style/IHT-check-your-nerves-at-the-door.html","abstract":"You might imagine that the World Poker Championship at Binion's Horseshoe casino in downtown Las Vegas is a roiling, moiling, no-holds- barred joust of hustlers, rustlers and Western dudes in ten-gallon hats, betting the ranch on a pair of aces.

Turn the dead man into a combination of the selfless good Samaritan played by James Stewart in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and the charming philanderer played by Cary Grant in \"The Awful Truth.\" Then fill out the cast of characters with an ensemble of women, played by classic Hollywood types.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940506","headline":"Zippos in Vietnam","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/opinion/l-zippos-in-vietnam-012530.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The Zippo lighters on display in Hanoi (pictured in \"Vietnam: Memorabilia of a War Best Forgotten,\" The Week in Review, April 24) were not dropped by careless G.I.'s as they scuttled home from Vietnam.
