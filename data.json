After its United States debut on Tuesday night at City Center, it is easy to see why.   The dancers, mainly Spanish but also drawn from the United States and other parts of the world, make an immediate connection with the audience. Their power is earthy, even elemental, drawing strength from the sand, fire and water that are never too remote from the imagery in Mr. Duato's choreography.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940512","headline":"Behind Clinton's Thunder, He Has No Bosnia Policy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/12/opinion/IHT-behind-clintons-thunder-he-has-no-bosnia-policy.html","abstract":"At a recent news conference, President Bill Clinton rejected a reporter's suggestion that his administration had constantly \"flip- flopped\" on Bosnia.

This year Schools Chancellor Ramon Cortines announced a new contract with the custodians that he described as \"revolutionary.\" But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sees the proposed contract as an empty shell that costs too much and requires very little of the custodians. He has vetoed the contract and wants to have his Labor Commissioner take the lead in negotiations.   This is a complicated issue, raised to a high emotional pitch by the recent budget battle that pitted the Mayor and the Chancellor against each other in a bruising public confrontation. In that battle, we stood squarely behind the Chancellor in his efforts to repel the Mayor's unwarranted intervention. But the school custodians are a special case; they run a system that has long defied rational control. The Mayor's instincts appear sound here: the city must not let pass an opportunity to rein in the custodians.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940512","headline":"U.S. Rejects French Proposal To Impose a Peace in Bosnia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/12/world/us-rejects-french-proposal-to-impose-a-peace-in-bosnia.html","abstract":"  United States officials today rejected France's call to impose a peace settlement in Bosnia.

The aim is to show that the American Impressionists and the American Realists have more in common than the history books say. They painted around the same time, similar things, with a similar attitude (a more rose-tinted and nationalistic one than their French counterparts had). So the exhibition argues, and to prove its point it brings together works by Impressionists like William Merritt Chase and Childe Hassam and by Realists like Robert Henri and George Bellows, 83 works in all.   The result? The two schools of painting look even less alike than you would have thought if you had thought about it at all. Or to put it another way, the differences between the Impressionists and the Realists turn out to be much more interesting visually than their similarities.

That would be a mistake. Mr. Jonassaint's appointment does not materially change the situation in Haiti. The new sanctions, set to begin May 21, should be given a chance to work.

But the Republicans who control the Senate, apparently relieved that Congress may act on an issue they had taken up only reluctantly at the state level, say the proposed Federal legislation would be sufficient. They do not intend to pursue a ban now but still want to stiffen penalties for people convicted of crimes committed with assault weapons, said a spokesman for the majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay. Cuomo Feels Strongly    So the issue will continue to be contentious this election year. Mr. Cuomo, who feels strongly about the ban personally, has also found it helpful politically to combat Republican charges that he is soft on crime.

It is up to the United States, they say, to take the first step and lift the sanctions against this unrepentant and bitter foe; everyone will benefit as a result. \n\n Yet I believe that the embargo should not be lifted, but tightened. Most of us Cuban exiles -- over 90 percent, according to a survey last year by the National Marketing Research Corporation -- hold this view.

What is undeniable is that the Europeans came up short, far short, when they got around to celebrating this latest technological marvel artistically. Suez (or more precisely, Cairo) had Verdi's \"Aida.\" The tunnel (or more precisely, Folkestone, where the tunnel emerges on the English side) had, in the waspish words of The Financial Times of London, \"well, some really nice Kentish choristers singing their hearts out in a tent.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940514","headline":"Gooden May Be Back Soon","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/14/sports/baseball-gooden-may-be-back-soon.html","abstract":"  Dwight Gooden could be back on the mound in 10 days even if it is only in an exhibition game. Yesterday at Shea Stadium, Gooden threw off the mound for the first time since he had a workout cut short in San Francisco on April 24 because of pain in his right big toe. It appears Gooden could return to the rotation at the end of the month.   Before last night's Mets-Braves game, Manager Dallas Green said he hoped to be able to get Gooden an inning or two of work on May 23, when the Mets play their Class AAA team in Norfolk. Gooden's availability for that game depends on how he responds to the work he does next week. Gooden is scheduled to take today off and throw again tomorrowand Monday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940514","headline":"Preakness Thins as Holy Bull Withdraws","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/14/sports/horse-racing-preakness-thins-as-holy-bull-withdraws.html","abstract":"  One day after it lost Brocco, the Preakness lost a star of even greater magnitude yesterday when Holy Bull was withdrawn with a mild infection and was aimed instead for the Metropolitan Mile at Belmont Park 10 days later.   \"It's not serious,\" said Jimmy Croll, the owner and trainer of Holy Bull. \"We took a routine blood test this morning, and the white-cell count was a little high.

If this were Germany, there would be fear, but Italy enjoys the reputation of being humane. The neo-Fascists perpetuate this myth by exploiting two durable myths -- that Fascism was not anti-Semitic and that Mussolini was a modernizer who permanently made the trains run on time.   This manipulation of history should add to worries about the ambitions of the three parties that make up the coalition: the neo-Fascist National Alliance, the separatist Northern League, and Forza Italia headed by Silvio Berlusconi, the political neophyte who will be Prime Minister.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940514","headline":"As Stich Backs Out, Sampras Looks Ahead","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/14/sports/IHT-as-stich-backs-out-sampras-looks-ahead.html","abstract":"An intriguing domestic collision was avoided Friday when the No. 2 seed, Michael Stich, pulled out of his Italian Open quarterfinal with the suddenly clay- friendly Boris Becker.
