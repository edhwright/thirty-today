Mayoral aides charged that the agency had overspent its budget by millions, funneled gobs of money into the re-election effort of former Mayor David Dinkins and perhaps even tried to obstruct an investigation by stealing computer files from its offices.    A report by the city's own Department of Investigation now finds the key allegations untrue or distorted.

The analogy of 1960's hair now clipped to lawyer length is tempting, but maybe Mr. Penderecki simply ran out of theatric devices.   This brief piece juxtaposes long viola, cello and violin solos in wide-spaced intervals with pounding string chords, buzzing triplets and busy fugal textures. The \"Sinfonietta\" is well-built music. It never forgets its original premises and refers back to them at the right times.

WELL, NOT QUITE To both its proponents and critics, the slotless slot machine, as it is known, represents something of an artful high-tech dodge of state laws that prohibit slot machines in New York, even on Indian reservations where casino gambling is allowed. They provide the individualized, fast-paced and uncomplicated gambling that slot machine users crave. But because they have no levers, do not require players to insert money and do not return money -- a player's winnings or losses are recorded on computer -- the terminals don't seem to fit the legal definition of a slot machine.

Sviatoslav Richter that Philips Classics has titled a new 21-CD set \"Richter: The Authorized Recordings.\" The title automatically invokes all the unauthorized recordings Mr. Richter has inspired: disks on obscure labels that often sound as if they had been made using microphones concealed in overcoats, perhaps by the devoted fans who have tracked this eccentric, reclusive artist from obscure hall to obscure hall.   For despite the fact that Mr. Richter, at 80, could instantly sell out any concert hall in the world, he tends to avoid the major stops. He has performed in a 700-year-old granary near Tours, France, where he has been associated with the Touraine Festival, and in monastery libraries in Bavaria.

They do so in the grand spirit of freely loathing green plastic derbies, clay pipes, treacly commercial impulses, intimations of 19th-century ethnic stereotyping (when Irish immigrants were caricatured in the city prints as simian louts), and, of course, the annual threat of drunken poseurs further abusing the reputation of a small country with a greatly misunderstood history.   Instead they'll take in a concert by Black 47. This is a vibrant rock band of Irish and Irish-Americans whose thumping lyrics speak viscerally to Kate and Martin of what's truly Irish on both sides of the Atlantic. Black 47 is named in memory of 1847, the peak year of Ireland's mammoth tragedy called the Great Hunger, the national famine in which hundreds of thousands died and millions more took to the seas in most mournful emigration. \"The fog of death deepens and lies upon the land,\" Black 47 keens in its angry look back.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"BEST SELLERS: March 12, 1995","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/books/best-sellers-march-12-1995.html","abstract":"                   Weeks    This   Last   On    Week   Week   List   Fiction              1   1   54   THE CELESTINE PROPHECY, by James Redfield.

How can it not be? Architecture is a social art. To a more or less conspicuous degree, every building bears the imprint of the social contract. And last November's elections expressed a national desire to renegotiate the terms of that contract.  Sooner or later, that desire will express itself in built form. If things go according to the Contract With America, architects can at least look forward to a brisk trade designing prisons.   A correctional facility may not be every architect's idea of a dream commission, but it could stand as a good symbol for the grim mood in which much of the profession now finds itself. Thus far, the 90's have not been golden years for architecture. Many architects were thrown out of work by the recession and remain underemployed, at least by standards of the 1980's. Some feel cut adrift by the absence of a unifying ideology or style. Others are feeling displaced by the exaggerated claims for cyberspace and virtual reality: will buildings be reduced to mere pit stops on the information highway? Above all, perhaps, many feel let down by the Clinton Administration and its failure to bring architects together behind a compelling urban vision.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"Topiaries And Teapots, And a Tide Of Visitors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/nyregion/topiaries-and-teapots-and-a-tide-of-visitors.html","abstract":"  Building from a steady trickle to a mid-day stream to an afternoon raging river, New Yorkers yesterday descended on their newest commercial bauble, Crate and Barrel, a furniture and housewares superstore at Madison Avenue and 59th Street.

It was the first night after Tet, the lunar new year, and although Communist attacks the night before had caused the official annual Tet cease-fire to be canceled, the city was full of visitors celebrating the holiday. Like the rest, Sau and his friends had come to town by bus or on foot, carrying holiday packages. But Nguyen Van Sau and the others were not in Saigon to celebrate. They were members of Sapper Battalion C-10 of the Vietcong and their packages were weapons.    Sau had grown up illiterate in Cu Chi Province, just outside the capital. In the National Liberation Front, he had learned to read and write, and had been instructed in the front's version of exalted patriotism. As a special honor, he was invited to join the Communist Party. And now he had been singled out again. The men and women of Sapper Battalion C-10 were going to attack the United States Embassy.     At around 2:45 A.M., their little convoy set out. It consisted of two vehicles: an old Peugeot van and a taxi of the same make, both familiar vehicles on Saigon streets. The embassy was a fortress, nearly new, a $2.5 million complex that fairly dominated downtown Saigon. Its key buildings featured shatterproof plexiglass, and the entire compound was surrounded by an eight-foot wall.    Shortly before 3 A.M., the guerrillas in the taxi opened fire on the military police post at the main entrance. The M.P.'s returned fire and slammed shut and padlocked the steel gate. The Vietcong in the van, which stopped around the corner, used an antitank explosive to breach the wall. In seconds a commando squad of about two dozen was pouring through it. The two M.P.'s turned to face them. The first American to die was Specialist 4 Charles L. Daniel of Durham, N.C. He and his partner, Pfc. William Sebast of Albany, fell defending their positions, and their refusal to yield or withdraw probably spoiled the attack.    U.S. reinforcements were soon brought to bear, and the battle for the embassy grounds went on through the night. By around 9 A.M., all of the attackers had been killed or captured. The American dead consisted of the two M.P.'s and one marine. The Communists had failed to gain entrance to a single building.    Up until that point in the war, nearly 20,000 Americans had died along with hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese. More than 58,000 Americans and an estimated four million Vietnamese -- soldiers and civilians -- would die before it was over.    During the early hours of Jan. 31, 1968, there was fierce fighting in Saigon and all over Vietnam. But the attack on the embassy, in its quixotic effrontery, was perhaps the engagement that most fascinated the world.   In January, I spent a few days in Saigon, which is now called Ho Chi Minh City, just as Sixth Avenue in New York is formally called the Avenue of the Americas. It was coming up on Tet and everyone was buying presents; people were carrying little potted tangerine trees and apricot flowers, and visitors from up north were carrying peach boughs and blossoms, which don't grow in the southern part of the country.    The town was booming as never before. Foreign businessmen, including plenty of Americans, were everywhere. On the roof of the Rex, the hotel that once was the American bachelor officers' quarters, tourists and local plutocrats were dining on frogs' legs. The old gourmet restaurants are gone, but new ones seem to be opening every day.    On what was the Rue Catinat before it was Tu Do Street, before it was Dong Khoi Street, antique porcelain and jewelry are for sale to prosperous buyers. Visitors can buy silk dresses, made to measure by shops whose employees will gladly stitch through the night to have the garments ready first thing in the morning.     Diners at the Rex can watch the streets below illuminated by Toshiba and Sony neon signs that turn night into day. A few old billboards enjoin Marxist morality -- one condemns bootlegging -- but the touts and the girls and the transvestites are all back in the same old places.     What would it be like to take a walk around town with Specialist Daniel, Private Sebast and Nguyen Van Sau and his comrades of C-10 one of these lovely holiday evenings, 27 years after the attack that killed them? Would they guess who had won the war in which they died? Surely the Americans would have thought it was their side. And Sau might be amazed at the fruits of the Communists' victory.    Vietnamese Communism was not going to threaten Durham, N.C., as the men who recruited young Daniel doubtless assured him it was. It was not even going to trouble Saigon all that long.    Nor was the earth about to rise on new foundations for Sau, although he might take some comfort in the new name for the G.I.s' old haunt, Tu Do Street.     Dong Khoi, formerly Tu Do, the street where you get the antique jewelry and porcelain, means Spontaneous Uprising -- presumably the one Sau and his friends waited all night in vain for in 1968. Although the uprising never came, they changed the street name anyhow. That's how politicians are.     Today, many a deal is in the making. In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, new factories will soon make Wisk liquid soap and Sunlight detergent for the Vietnamese kitchen. And before long, there will be a new U.S. embassy in Hanoi.     How ironic it all is. Perhaps such a squandering of young lives ought to be consigned to the realm of private grief, reflecting more shame than glory on the causes served. Yet we find ourselves moved and inspired by the heroism of young people who do their duty, who serve with all the vigor of their youth, strength and courage. The political futility of their sacrifice gives it a poignancy that is somehow ennobling. Even the Hemingway of \"A Farewell to Arms,\" professing revulsion at the rhetoric of heroism, movingly employed it and became the high priest of martial virtue.    After a period of denial and ambiguity, the United States began erecting fitting monuments to the Americans who died in our futile war. Somehow we can't keep ourselves from honoring those who give their lives in the wars to which our shortsightedness and folly consign them. Yet we know that in every war lives are lost, meaninglessly, and that the cause behind their sacrifice is soon rendered irrelevant.     We have never succeeded in replacing proper conduct on the field of battle as the ultimate measure of courage and loyalty. We have not developed that \"moral equivalent of war\" that William James so wisely and impossibly called for. Knowing not a whit more than the ancient Greeks, we console ourselves as they did in catharsis, in stoic acceptance and tragic ritual. Our celebration of death in battle is, from a certain perspective, utterly irrational. Yet it is our only means of imposing some degree of meaning on war's meaningless destruction, the only way we have of facing the eternal ironies of history.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"Sandra Milberg, David H.

When the English actress Fanny Kemble visited the town (\"the oldest I have yet seen in America\") in 1838, she wrote, \"The appearance of the city is highly picturesque, a word which can apply to none other of the American towns.\" The residents agree. Long before the Civil War threatened their cherished way of life, Charlestonians were notoriously attached to their past.\n\nLuckily for both visitors and local people, the object of their affections is astonishingly present, despite war, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. Charleston is shaped like a big toe wading into the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, and its oldest section (traditionally but too strictly limited to the streets \"south of Broad\"), at its tip, offers the opposite of Rip Van Winkle's experience. The visitor is modern but steps mysteriously into a late-18th-century-early-19th-century town of two- to three-story buildings, the low skyline interrupted only by church spires. Built tight to the sidewalk in a variety of styles and materials, the buildings keep surprisingly harmonious company. Even more unexpectedly, there is very little that feels phony or trapped-in-amber about Charleston's Historic District: the basketball net in front of the undulating wrought-iron fence at 36 Meeting Street (circa 1740) is typical of the area's convincingly lived-in look.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"'In the Natural State' And Hunting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/nyregion/l-in-the-natural-state-and-hunting-107495.html","abstract":"  Re the Jan. 29 letter to the New Jersey editor by Gloria J.

Rather, the reports are intended as a base point from which to begin to chart how a school performs from year to year. These are some indicators included in the Annual School Report: STUDENTS: Number of students registered as of October 1993. TYPE: (A) Alternative, (C) Academic or Comprehensive, (V) Vocational, (S) Specialized. GRADUATING: Percentage of the Class of 1994 graduating on time. READING: Percentage of the Class of 1994 meeting minimum New York State reading requirements for graduation. MATH: Percentage of the Class of 1994 meeting minimum New York State math requirements for graduation. ATTENDANCE: Average daily attendance. SUSPENSIONS: Per 100 students. STAFF RATIO: Number of students for every administrator, teach and other professional staff member. TEACHER EXPERIENCE: Percentage of teachers teaching five years or less. SAT VERBAL: Average score for students in the school who took the test. SAT MATH: Average score for students in the school who took the test. NOTES: Schools with no senior class in 1994 were excluded from the analysis; Graduation rate calculations were changed this year from previous years to exclude students who transfrred to non-New York City high schools or equivalency programs, some of whom later dropped out.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"Bookstores With, Oh Yes, Books Too","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/nyregion/bookstores-with-oh-yes-books-too.html","abstract":"THE temperature was in the teens, and a ferocious wind lashed the faces of the 35 men and women who sloggedthrough the ice and snow underfoot toward the Barnes & Noble superstore here on Route 36.

In a sense, what the jazz world has been experiencing -- the controversy over the direction a new generation is taking, the anxiety over what to make of the past, the re-examination of values -- is a collective midlife crisis. How, the implicit question seems to run, should this art form negotiate the passage, begun in the 1960's around the time that rock-and-roll became a major industry, from being the coolest new kid on the esthetic and commercial block to a role as a mature, though still evolving, music with a body of recognized, classic work behind it?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"Woman Shot by Attacker Who Flees in Her Car","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/nyregion/woman-shot-by-attacker-who-flees-in-her-car.html","abstract":"  An elderly woman was ambushed in the driveway of her home on Friday night in West Caldwell, N.J., by a teen-ager who shot her in the face without saying a word and then fled in her car, leading to a wild chase through quiet suburban streets that ended in the capture of two suspects, the authorities said.

In the first 2 of the 40 cases reviewed in New Jersey, the high court upheld the law but threw out the death sentences because of flaws it found in trial procedure or prosecutorial misconduct. The court handed down more than two dozen more reversals before upholding a death sentence, and it used the opportunity of the review process to instruct judges and prosecutors in how to conduct capital punishment trials. One common mistake, the Supreme Court said, was that judges often failed to charge the jury correctly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"Lee Northshield and Myles Thompson","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/style/vows-lee-northshield-and-myles-thompson.html","abstract":"  People in publishing are clubby.

Music, ordinarily resilient to historical turmoil, bears deep and lasting scars. Half a century ago, Anton Webern was shot outside his Austrian home by an American soldier; the Czech composers Viktor Ullmann, Pavel Haas and Gideon Klein were killed at Auschwitz; and Bela Bartok died in New York, an impoverished exile. This year also happens to be the centenary of the German composer Carl Orff, whose music has been seriously compromised by Nazi associations. Haunted by these intrusions of reality into utopian musical life, the European music festivals this summer take on a darkly reflective tone.   The most ambitious of the war remembrances takes place in Dresden, a city that has not yet recovered fully from the Allied firebombing campaign of February 1945. Its offerings include Benjamin Britten's noble \"War Requiem\"; Bernd Alois Zimmermann's opera \"Die Soldaten,\" a scalding vision of the horror of war; and Richard Strauss's \"Friedenstag,\" a more ambiguous and dubious plea for peace first heard under Nazi auspices in 1938. The theme at Matthias Bamert's Lucerne Festival is \"Misunderstood Music,\" missing pieces of 20th-century musical history. Two potential highlights are a program of music by Ber thold Goldschmidt, a composer who fell into obscurity with the onset of the Nazi regime but continued to write music in England (Aug. 19); and a concert by the Czech Philharmonic in honor of Viktor Ullmann, who led a Jewish musical community at the Theresienstadt concentration camp (Sept. 2).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"A Brawl, Occasionally Interrupted","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-village-a-brawl-occasionally-interrupted.html","abstract":"  A husky man pummels a slighty built younger man, hurling him into a garage door.

Nanotechnology, which is still only a gleam in the eye of science, rearranges molecules the way a riverboat gambler shuffles a deck of cards. With sufficient energy and an ample supply of raw material, nanotechnology can convert any kind of matter into any other kind. Instead of letting this potent tool run away with his narrative, Mr. Stephenson wisely focuses on the social implications of a new materialism that is beyond the dreams of any previous Gilded Age.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"'Rock Is A Part of Me'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/arts/l-marketing-music-rock-is-a-part-of-me-808095.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Although I generally agree with Alex Ross's essay \"A Requiem for Amadeus?\"  [ Feb. 19 ] , in which he discusses current techniques in marketing classical music, I take issue with one point.

DOROTHEA LANGE: A Visual Life (Smithsonian Institution, cloth, $55; paper, $24.95) includes scholarly essays and personal remembrances about Lange (1895-1965) -- the feminist heroine; the wife, lover and mother; the photographer of Japanese internment camps for the War Relocation Authority. There is also an interview with Ansel Adams, with whom Lange worked. (The editor, Elizabeth Partridge, as a youngster knew Lange intimately.) The longest and most interesting essay, by Sally Stein, who teaches art history at the University of California, Irvine, focuses on Lange's disability -- a lifelong limp as a result of childhood polio -- and its influence on her portraits. Lange often dropped down to focus on hands in relation to torso, or even lower to the position of the legs and feet. The most fascinating texts in the book, however, are Lange's, in a chapter entitled \"Dorothea Lange: Her Words and Images,\" and that of her oldest son, Daniel Dixon. He writes that his mother \"never described herself as an artist\" but as \"a 'witness,' an 'observer.' \" Lange was an artist, and the many photographs included here, some of her best known as well as more obscure images, bear witness to that fact.\nROBIN LIPPINCOTT","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"Incivility: To Act or Not to Act?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/nyregion/l-incivility-to-act-or-not-to-act-924595.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your article reminded me of one of my students who is 9.

But there are times like the first five minutes of the second half of yesterday's Big East tournament championship game when Connecticut looks very average and vulnerable, creating an unsettling feeling for UConn followers who are hoping for something more than unfulfilled expectations from the coming National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950313","headline":"Words and Music, as Personified in 2 Careers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/arts/television-review-words-and-music-as-personified-in-2-careers.html","abstract":"  It's pledge time again on public television and that means, apart from program interruptions for contribution pitches, lots of specials that have little or no connection with PBS's normal schedules. Programs on the music of Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey are established favorites. This year they are joined by programs devoted to -- would you believe -- the sounds of Lawrence Welk and John Tesh.    There are, however, classier acts. Tonight, for instance, lovers of the American musical theater can find \"Some Enchanted Evening: Celebrating Oscar Hammerstein 2d,\" taped in January before an invited audience at City Center in Manhattan. And on Wednesday, operagoers can settle in comfortably with an \"American Masters\" presentation, \"Placido Domingo: A Musical Life.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950313","headline":"How Leo Frank's Death Fueled Fight for Justice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/opinion/l-how-leo-frank-s-death-fueled-fight-for-justice-717595.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"The Lynching of Leo Frank,\" an advertisement for the Teaching Tolerance Project of the Southern Poverty Law Center (Op-Ed page, March 5), needs a postscript.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950313","headline":"DANCE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/arts/in-performance-dance-725695.html","abstract":"  Just Ordinary People Fallen From Grace  Phyllis Lamhut Dance Company Bessie Schonberg Theater    Phyllis Lamhut's new \"Deadly Sins\" got off to a pungent start on Friday night, as five bodies emerged from a gloomy corner of the darkened stage to move to music with distinctive hints of Kurt Weill. Ms. Lamhut's dancers tend to look, refreshingly, like people one might notice on any urban street corner.

The Republican plan, which entails a $2.9 billion reduction in the growth that was projected in Federal child welfare programs over the next five years, has raised alarms from some state officials and child advocacy groups. These critics worry that the reduction is coming at a time when other proposed changes in the welfare program may force more poor women to relinquish custody of their children.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950313","headline":"'Line-Item Veto,' Right and Wrong","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/opinion/line-item-veto-right-and-wrong.html","abstract":"  Of all the pledges in the Republicans' Contract With America, there is just one that President Clinton would be genuinely happy to see enacted -- the line-item veto, technically known as \"rescission.\" The Senate is about to consider two versions. Both would give him more power to block spending on pork-barrel projects and other special favors that Congress tucks into appropriations bills.   One version would dangerously increase the President's already formidable powers. The other, sponsored by Senator Pete Domenici, would give the President more power than he has now, counter-balanced by reasonable Congressional checks. The Senate should go with Mr. Domenici, chairman of its Budget Committee.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950313","headline":"Christopher Recuses Himself On Conoco's Iranian Oil Deal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/world/christopher-recuses-himself-on-conoco-s-iranian-oil-deal.html","abstract":"  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that he has withdrawn from policy discussions on a sensitive oil deal between Conoco Inc. and Iran because his former law firm is representing the American company.
