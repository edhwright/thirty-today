Dioxin, which is a probable cause of cancer and of developmental disorders, is largely produced from the combustion of such chlorine-containing substances as plastics. Therefore, the main source of dioxins is incinerator smokestacks. In addition, incineration releases other pollutants and also contributes to global warming.   Yet instead of outlawing incinerators, worldwide experience suggests that it is better to create a recycling-friendly economic environment. This is achieved by mandating that newspapers be printed on recycled paper and that soda be sold in recycled bottles.   Once such laws take effect, a market develops for used newspapers and soda bottles, and consequently they disappear from regular garbage. The combustible fraction in municipal waste drops to the point where the garbage can no longer be burned, and therefore incineration is phased out.   Worldwide experience also shows that when regulations treat the dioxin-containing fly-ash from incinerators as toxic waste, resulting disposal costs tend to work against incineration and in favor of recycling.   It can be concluded that if the proper regulations exist, economic forces will support recycling. On a per-ton basis, recycling in populated areas will cost half as much as landfilling and one-third as much as incineration. In addition, the recycling industry creates low-skilled jobs and reduces pollution.

It is probably unnecessary to say that in the hands of a troupe called the Five Lesbian Brothers, the vision takes on a decidedly different aspect.   \"The Secretaries,\" written and performed by the Brothers under Kate Stafford's direction, is a thinly protracted, if sometimes very funny, exercise in subverting American images of womanhood. The story of a quintet of covertly homicidal office employees in an Oregon lumber mill, it plays on anxious male fantasies of what women do when they're alone together; straight women's fantasies of lesbians (they're predatory); lesbians' fantasies of straight women (they're secretly lesbians), and the warping cultural expectations of femininity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940922","headline":"Mother's Fight for Son Loses to Lure of Streets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/22/nyregion/mother-s-fight-for-son-loses-to-lure-of-streets.html","abstract":"  Cherise Wade saw the blood on the television news Tuesday, her boy's blood, dripping down the steps of a Brooklyn housing project.

The CMJ Music Marathon is in town this weekend, turning most rock clubs into band-crammed showcases that start early and run into the wee hours. The only connection between these four bands is that they record for Warner Brothers and its associated labels. American Music Club (at 10:40 P.M.) is a lodestone for depressives, with Mark Eitzel's bleary, self-lacerating ruminations set in rock that's sometimes crisp and sometimes dreamy and atmospheric. Soul Coughing (8:50) backs M. Doughty's free-associative poetry and an occasional melodic chorus with jazz vamps and sampled noises. Grant Lee Buffalo (9:40), a three-man rock band led by Grant Lee Phillips, gazes at Americana with a literary eye in songs that move from folk-rock to Neil Young stomps to late-Beatles pop, while St. Etienne (11:50) creates a swirling, post-disco reverie. The show is tonight, beginning at 8. Admission: $13.50. JON PARELES Jeff Buckley    Jeff Buckley, Supper Club, 240 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 249-8870. Jeff Buckley's eerie, liquid, androgynous voice can't help reminding people of his father, Tim Buckley. But he uses it to personalize his own emotionally volatile songs, which drift from pained delicacy to hard rock on the verge of Led Zeppelin. In a CMJ showcase, he shares a bill with Tindersticks, whose understated songs can take on an edge of dissonance. Tomorrow at 7 P.M.; tickets are $10. J. P. Roosevelt (Booba) Barnes    Roosevelt (Booba) Barnes, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, at 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Roosevelt Barnes comes from the juke joints of Mississippi, and he plays unvarnished Delta blues: a spiky, syncopated dialogue between his electric guitar and his deep, unflinching voice, finding new resonances in the classic blues subjects of trouble and pleasure. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9:30, 11 and 12:30. Admission: $10 cover charge and a two-drink minimum at the tables. J.

He is bothered by a pinched nerve in his left shoulder and his status is uncertain for the start of the season.   Today, Terreri faced shots for the first time since suffering the injury on Sept. 10.   \"It wasn't bad,\" Terreri said after the light workout before the rest of the team took the ice, \"but it wasn't great, either. It'll take some time.\"   With three exhibition games left, time is not on Terreri's side. Goaltenders Peter Sidorkiewicz and Mike Dunham have played well and are making a strong challenge to start the season with Brodeur. But Terreri, a six-year-veteran, said it was too early for him to worry about losing his job.   \"I've played so long in this league it won't take me long to get into conditioning,\" Terreri said. \"But it is frustrating not to be able to do the things I want to do. It's just taking too much time.\"   Despite the intensive therapy on his shoulder, it is unlikely that Terreri will see any action before the regular season, which is scheduled to start Oct. 1.   \"If Chris is not ready, for sure we'll have to keep another goalie,\" Coach Jacques Lemaire said after today's practice. \"Chris will be going in and practice every day until he gets ready.\"   Dressed in black, Terreri swung his left arm as he skated up and down the ice. He tested his endurance with a few short sprints, from the goal line to the blue line. Then he faced shots from Jacques Caron, the goaltending coach, and the assistant coaches Larry Robinson and Dennis Gendron.   \"We took low shots at him today because of his range of motion and we'll start taking high and harder shots at him gradually,\" Caron said.   Any hope Terreri had of challenging Brodeur for the position as the team's premier goaltender has disappeared.   Brodeur has looked extremely sharp in the exhibition games he played, especially in the 4-1 victory over the Flyers Wednesday night. Several of his 30 saves were of the spectacular kind and he lost his shutout bid with only 36 seconds left.   Brodeur keeps saying he can handle a heavy workload, but Lemaire is inclined not to overwork his top goaltender early in the season. Lemaire prefers to have two goalies sharing the duties until he settles on one of them for the playoffs, as he did last year. SLAP SHOTS    PETER SIDORKIEWICZ and MIKE DUNHAM will handle the goaltending duties for Friday night's visit by the Islanders. . . .

It might be stretching things to call the obscure California collagist and painter known simply as Jess one of the great missing links of this period. But the phrase applies with special accuracy to his sometimes mesmerizing, sometimes repellent art, the subject of a fascinating retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art.   Linkage, especially of unlikely qualities and disparate times and styles, is one of the central aspects of Jess's work, with its unsettling mixture of radical and conservative impulses, of obsessive painterliness, wide-ranging literariness and plain old kitschiness. And Jess is also in some sense missing: a virtual recluse who rarely leaves his house in San Francisco, he is a legend to a small clutch of devoted collectors, critics and curators, but unknown to many others on the contemporary art scene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940923","headline":"DIALOGUE: The Reach of Democracy; Tying Power To Diplomacy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/23/opinion/dialogue-the-reach-of-democracy-tying-power-to-diplomacy.html","abstract":"  To many Americans, the cold war divisions have given way to a confusing tangle of problems that prevent us from setting clearly defined goals for our foreign policy.

Beneath the surface, however, there is an enduring truth about this new world. The same idea attacked by Fascism and Communism remains under attack today. Now, as then, we are defending an idea that comes under many names -- democracy, liberty, civility, pluralism -- but has a constant face.
