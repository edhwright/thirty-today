Mr. Browne developed his reputation in the early 1970's as a folk-rock songwriter with a singular gift for describing the emotional landscapes of intimate relationships.

An understandable favorite of schools and stock companies, it received a fondly remembered, intimate production at the Entermedia and Royale Theaters in 1982.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931111","headline":"Whitbread Leg 2: A Head-Down Dash for Australia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/11/sports/IHT-whitbread-leg-2-a-headdown-dash-for-australia.html","abstract":"The yachts in the Whitbread 'Round the World race set sail again at noon Saturday from Punta del Este, Uruguay, to surf downwind the 7,500 nautical miles to Fremantle, in Western Australia, through the icy green waters and screaming gales of the Southern","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931111","headline":"Russians Wonder if Revolt's Casualties Were Higher Than Reported","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/11/world/russians-wonder-if-revolt-s-casualties-were-higher-than-reported.html","abstract":"  In a country that voraciously devours conspiracy theories, the relatively low death toll in the showdown last month between President Boris N.

As he languorously stretches his legs, the performer, wearing full makeup, a woman's marcelled wig and a glittering circus suit, is a dead ringer for the Parisian legend as pictured in well-known photographs taken by Man Ray. But he is also more than that. In the show's exquisite lighting, Mr. Kelly glows like a human jewel radiating a mysterious brilliance in a luminescent purple haze.    That visual payoff, as haunting as it may be, is a little late in arriving in the leisurely paced 90-minute collage, which had the first of four performances at the Majestic on Wednesday evening. What Mr. Kelly, who wrote, choreographed, and directed the piece, has created is an often lovely but overly drawn-out meditation on muses, ghosts, Paris in the 20's, transvestism, and the art of Jean Cocteau.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/arts/art-in-review-816993.html","abstract":"  Noriyuki Haraguchi   Akira Ikeda  130 Prince Street  SoHo  Through Nov. 20    The Japanese sculptor Noriyuki Haraguchi's particular gift is for making an elegant -- sometimes too elegant -- thing of industrial forms and materials, as he has demonstrated in two consecutive solo exhibitions, his first in New York.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"Senator Targets Bowls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/sports/sports-people-colleges-senator-targets-bowls.html","abstract":"  At the request of Senator MITCH McCONNELL, Republican of Kentucky, the United States Justice Department has agreed to look into whether an agreement between a coalition of college conferences and major post-season bowls violates antitrust laws.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/style/chronicle-821593.html","abstract":"  Organizers of a benefit for the American Ballet Theater on Monday are billing it as a \"family party,\" but the evening will hardly be a couple of relatives around the kitchen table.

It is a circumstance that was thrown into sharp relief last week when the producers of \"Perestroika,\" Part 2 of \"Angels in America,\" announced they were postponing its opening from Thursday, Nov. 18, until the following Tuesday, thus upsetting what had been a rather precariously balanced schedule.   Producers of Broadway shows are required to register their opening nights with the League of American Theaters and Producers, reserving the dates as long in advance as possible so that the league can orchestrate schedules and keep conflicts to a minimum. Less officially but for the convenience of all, the league has for the last few years also kept track of Off Broadway openings, but the Off Broadway theaters all understand that they are somewhat at the mercy of Broadway shows, which take precedence. Indeed, weeks ago, when \"Perestroika\" first assumed the Nov. 18 date, it bumped the Manhattan Theater Club's production of Donald Margulies's play \"The Loman Family Picnic.\" The theater then moved \"Loman\" to Nov. 23, where last Friday it found itself under the feet of \"Angels\" once again.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"Sports of The Times; Acknowledge The Past; Pass It On","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/sports/sports-of-the-times-acknowledge-the-past-pass-it-on.html","abstract":"  RITUAL?

He started out at 9 A.M., and except for \"toilet stops\" and \"the last time I had ice cream\" he didn't stop running until the following morning at 7 A.M. He was never more than five miles from his apartment, and he was only worried that drunks might harass him when the bars closed. It was a typically uneventful and painful 101.5-mile run in which he thought about \"opponents,\" felt the addictive rise of endorphins and self-esteem and considered new techniques of measuring road race courses, which he considers his legacy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"Kohl Defends European Unity to Doubters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/world/kohl-defends-european-unity-to-doubters.html","abstract":"  Rejecting skepticism about the European Community in his supporters' ranks, Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Parliament today that for Germany there was \"no alternative\" to closer European unity.   \"In the long term, I am firmly convinced that this is also a question of war and peace,\" he said. \"It's a grave mistake if people think the horrific pictures from the former Yugoslavia are limited to that area of Europe, or that racism, nationalism, chauvinism and xenophobia in other parts of Europe and in Germany have been banished once and for all.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"Why Americans Distrust Clinton on Trade Pact; Retraining's Failure","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/opinion/l-why-americans-distrust-clinton-on-trade-pact-retraining-s-failure-828293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The views expressed by Tony Snow and James Carville in \"Victory Made (Sort of) Easy\" (Op-Ed, Nov. 2) are loaded with pro-North American Free Trade Agreement and pro-business arguments.

For this brilliant and endearing showpiece was not written for the ages. It celebrated a specific event: the coronation of King Charles X of France in 1825. And as its 14-part finale testifies, it was also a form of advertisement, a way of exploiting individually the roster of singers Rossini had at his disposal at the Theatre-Italien in Paris.   The seeming inappropriateness of \"Il Viaggio a Reims\" for anything but its specific purposes pushed it out of sight for a century and a half. Its music has died less easily, much of it diverted into another Rossini opera, \"Le Comte Ory.\" But musicologists have been busy the past 20 years, and through a combination of luck and persistence, they have reassembled Rossini's original score with apparent accuracy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931113","headline":"Russians Discover Capitalism's Harsher Realities","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/13/world/russians-discover-capitalism-s-harsher-realities.html","abstract":"  The 30 pensioners dining on a free meal at the Center for Social Protection in Moscow's Kuzminki region were complaining loudly about life since the collapse of Communism, when the waitress interrupted them.   \"What are you griping about?\" demanded Natasha, a stout 33-year-old already missing a few teeth. \"You are old, your life is behind you, you already have what you need.

There was little doubt about the consequences of her subsequent kiss -- the legends about this fatal attraction are clear -- but in this exceptional performance of the lush opera, the death of the prince and Rusalka's sinking below the lake's surface were startlingly powerful. Dvorak alluded to Wagner in these scenes, almost quoting \"Tristan,\" while creating his own distinctive love-death.   Gabriela Benackova, who has made a specialty of the role of Rusalka, gave a performance that had classic status. One wasn't conscious of individual notes, only of eloquently shaped phrases. She sang with a natural ease that carried great authority, giving an unearthly vulnerability to her character; one chromatic sigh seemed to hover in space.

Inadequate terminal facilities at the airports will doom the project. Kennedy and La Guardia, unlike most other airports, do not have central terminals. Passengers must go outside and try to find infrequent buses from terminal to terminal. The proposed $2 billion project will not change this.    The Transit Authority's attempt at providing rail transit to Kennedy Airport failed because it was a train to a bus. The proposed Federal Circle terminal at J.F.K. is no closer to the airline terminals than the Transit Authority's Howard Beach station.   Much money will be spent to link this route to rail facilities at Jamaica Station to lure passengers from Nassau or Suffolk counties. This does not account for the infrequency of Long Island Rail Road service. Airport service must run at least once every 20 minutes to be practical.

The bill would require contractors to pay so-called prevailing wages on \"public works.\" That might sound innocent enough -- except that prevailing wages mean high union wages, and the definition of public works has been expanded well beyond its usual meaning of schools and bridges to include private projects, like low-cost housing, that receive tax and other public subsidies.    The bill would raise the cost of construction, undermining community groups who scrape together public and private funds to build low-cost housing. And it would wipe out many small contractors who survive by hiring low-cost, nonunion labor and, in any case, wouldn't be able to deal with the enormous paperwork. That's why minority contractors have organized to defeat the bill.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931113","headline":"Giuliani Begins Search for New Police Commissioner","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/13/nyregion/giuliani-begins-search-for-new-police-commissioner.html","abstract":"  Mayor-elect Rudolph W.
