The Amusins. You Gotta Bereave. Even the wordplay involving the Mets in 1993 is exhausted.    Only Al Harazin and Jeff Torborg, perhaps on a cruise together somewhere, are the only ones likely to be enjoying the All-Star break. They, after all, are the only ones who no longer have to report to Shea to pick up their paychecks.  TEFLON DON   John Franco, the self-appointed clubhouse capo, has treated Queens residents to regular fireworks shows. Unfortunately, most have been staged when he's been on the mound. Doctors revise their diagnoses of his surgically repaired left elbow to deflect responsibility for his performances. The hard truth is that Franco, who has been awarded two lavish contract extensions since his arrival, has a history of failure. He folded September 1990, had one of the worst ratios of baserunners allowed per nine innings in 1991, was hurt in 1992 and has been abjectly ordinary this season. He has blown a third of his save opportunities, has allowed 20 hits and 10 walks in 19 2/3 innings and in only four of his 19 appearances has he managed no to allow a hit. Still, Dallas Green calls him an \"untouchable.\" COMIC DRAMA   Dwight Gooden's dread over the impending departure of Mel Stottlemyre. Hey, Doc, be grateful it hasn't happened sooner. Stottlemyre, despite a track record of failing to do much with young pitchers for the Mets and not exactly enhancing the caliber of the club's veteran pitchers, has somehow survived in baseball's most precarious position. URSA FROM MINORS   It has become de riguer to ridicule the club's minor league system. But Jeromy Burnitz's explosion at Shea (4 homers, 12 r.b.i.) demosstrates that the vault for young talent isn't empty. The outfielder runs hard, talks tough and his teammates speak about Burnitz's power in the hushed tones of the spiritually transformed. FIGURES DON'T LIE   The season's most appalling numbers? Do you fancy a 9-33 record in games decided by one or two runs? How about 64 straight without who consecutive triumphs. No? Try the fact that the '93 Mets haven't won three straight, ever. Or that they have failed to win a series at Shea since the season's opening pair of games against the Rockies. The Mets are 9-38 against club's with winning records. MOST EMBARRASSING NO-SHOW   Al Harazin, who forced Jeff Torborg to endure the cruel and needless ignominy of managing the game on the night he understood he would be fired, failed to turn up at the news conference announcing his own resignation, and even refused to return phone calls. Harazin also earns points for the cheapest shot of the season. The ex-general manager, who was the brains behind hiring Torborg and embracing his family philosophy of baseball, was drinking a beer with Dallas Green 48 hours after Torborg's dismissal, talking loudly for the media about the days \"of milk and cookies\" being gone for good. WORST LOSS   So much to choose from, but the 3-2 loss to the Pirates on June 20 gets the nod here. Bret Saberhagen entered the ninth with a 2-1 lead. He was soon gone, then John Franco walked in the tying run and yielded the decisive run. The Pirates, who had lost seven straight and were without Andy Van Slyke, completed a four-game sweep. BROOM DAY PROMOTION   The Mets have been swept in nine series over the first half. Market the talent, pass out the whisk brooms, let the fans clean up after themselves after the opposition has cleaned up the Mets. THE MEANING OF MATH   Bobby Bonilla has hit 20 homers and driven in 55 runs. He is midway through a statistically impressive year. Context confuses things, though. The $29 million right fielder was embroiled in personal turmoil and defanged at the plate when the season was being decided in April and May under Torborg. He says now he has been liberated by Green's presence and his own ability to \"get over the hump\" in New York. Maybe. Maybe not. A lot of the club's future hangs in the balance. Oh, and one has to wonder what the Mets will attach to Vince Coleman's recent revitalization -- no real significance or more misguided theorizing about the leadoff man's catalytic potential. STANDING O   Joe Orsulak, playing under the duress of knowing his 14-month-old child's life is endangered by heart problems, and playing with a club that can't boast anyone else of his instincts or work ethic, has hit .310, scored 27 runs and accumulated 5 outfield assists. GOING, GOING ...   Those with the most imperiled future under Dallas Green? Jeff Innis (the I-Man's talent has been I-nvisible), Chico (I'm the best infielder this club's got) Walker, Jeff McKnight (the man of many positions but no impact), Frank Tanana (who turned 40 recently and whose e.r.a. might get there yet.) WEIRDEST MOMENT   Mets, smiling and hugging, leaving the field after ninth-inning victory knowing Manager Jeff Torborg would be fired upon reaching the clubhouse. MOST DISTURBING MOMENT   Right now, as the ad says. There are 75 games to go.

Now it gets quite interesting for the Yankees. No pretenders allowed.   The Yankees lost eight of their last 10 games but stand, barely, in third place and one game out of first place in the American League East.  TEN TERRIBLE DAYS    They were horrible, and memorable. Eight losses on the West Coast trip before the All-Star Game break. The Yankees led in seven of those setbacks and incurred six one-run losses. They had two chances to join the Jays in first place and fumbled both times. \"I'm not pleased with that, but it could have been worse,\" said reliever Steve Howe. But it also could have been much better.  HOME SWEET HOME    The Yankees swept a three-game series from the Tigers in front of a total of 119,000 fans at Yankee Stadium before departing for the West Coast. Then they faltered. Jim Abbott said he noticed the team was flat in the first series in Oakland. \"It just dragged on,\" he said. But the Yankees can take solace because they play 18 of their next 21 at home, where they have won 14 of 16 and are 25-14 over all. The Stadium was turning into a raucous place for opposing teams. Will it continue? DON OR DAN? HOW ABOUT DON AND DAN    Don Mattingly and Danny Tartabull are the No. 3 and No. 4 hitters in the lineup, and their consistency was one of the few superlatives on the road trip. Both are cruising, and the Yankees desperately need them to continue. Tartabull is hitting .320 with seven homers and 15 r.b.i. over the last 19 games, and Mattingly is hitting .385 with 15 r.b.i. in the last 19 games. But Mattingly's r.b.i. total of 29 in 64 games is still paltry. ONLY KEY, NOT THE BIG THREE    Buck Showalter drooled. Jimmy Key, Melido Perez and Jim Abbott in the rotation. A fearsome threesome, each capable of winning 20. Not quite. Only Key (11-2, 2.31 e.r.a.) has been special. Abbott and Perez are each 5-8 and are allowing about 1.5 runs more per nine innings than they did last year. \"I've been battling,\" Abbott said. Added Perez, \"I'm going to the Dominican to work on my problems.\"  SUBSTITUTE TURNS STAR    Quite possibly the best Yankee story of the season so far. Mike Stanley, career backup, seizes the chance to start, hits .316, already has a career high in homers with 11 and is two r.b.i. behind Tartabull for the team lead at 41. He calls games deftly and is a nice guy who has become a Yankee spokesman of sorts. \"If I start pinching myself or saying I'm not this good, it will stop,\" Stanley said.  BULLPEN: THE PEAKS, THE VALLEYS    They have been up, they have been down. Steve Farr saved 17 straight games at one point, but has mishandled the last three. Steve Howe still has an e.r.a. over 6.50, Bobby Munoz and Rich Monteleone have pitched capably in some tight situations but are still over 4.00, and the bullpen has a league-worst 4.78. It is the most likely place for a player change for the second half. Top right-handed prospects Domingo Jean and Mark Hutton are not being observed closely at Class AAA Columbus because the Yankees are enamored with winning the International League playoffs. WILD CARD    General Manager Gene Michael has seemingly relaxed his pursuit of a pitcher because teams are trying to take advantage of George Steinbrenner's impatience and fleece the Yankees. Montreal wanted Bob Wickman, Hutton and minor-league third baseman Russ Davis for Dennis Martinez? Please. If the club felt Hutton or Jean could assist in the rotation, Showalter would prefer that route. But Steinbrenner adores marquee names, and trade possibilities could intensify at any moment. \"It's a tough call,\" said Showalter, when asked about promoting from within or obtaining a starter.  HITTING HIS STRIDE    If John Olerud was not imitating Ted Williams, Paul O'Neill would be battling for a batting title. Imagine that. A career .259 hitter is batting .329. He has been a superb addition and Showalter has done his best managing job with O'Neill, no batting champion against left-handers. GEORGE IS WATCHING    He may not be making much noise publicly, but George Steinbrenner always watches closely. He called the Anaheim Stadium press box in the first inning of Saturday night's game with the Angels and asked to speak to a Yankee official. Then he called Manager Buck Showalter in his office about 90 minutes before Sunday's first pitch.  MILES TO GO BEFORE HE SLEEPS    Buck Showalter He does not sleep enough. He rarely exercises. He watches game film until his eyelids are droopy. He takes the losses much tougher than any of his players. If the Yankees remain in contention, or even if they don't, Showalter might erupt. He was ornery after some of the difficult setbacks on the West Coast and called a rare team meeting, but claimed everything was fine. \"No one likes to lose when you have a chance to win,\" Showalter said. He should relax a bit, take his daughter to a movie.  THE FINAL WORD    Steve Howe, who has been suspended from the major leagues seven times for repeated drug violations, told reporters Sunday, \"I passed my urine test. I'll see you all after the All-Star break.\"  ","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930713","headline":"In the War for Hong Kong, It's Britain vs. Britain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/13/opinion/IHT-in-the-war-for-hong-kong-its-britain-vs-britain.html","abstract":"If Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, and Britain's policy on Hong Kong are to maintain credibility, Prime Minister John Major needs to appoint an ambassador to Beijing who believes in their stated goals.

He also developed an abiding faith in what he saw as the sea's untapped economic potential.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930713","headline":"LABOR CONCESSIONS GAINED BY MURDOCH RESTORE THE POST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/13/nyregion/labor-concessions-gained-by-murdoch-restore-the-post.html","abstract":"  Employees of The New York Post, shut out of the building for two days, returned to put out today's issue after most of the newspaper's unions gave Rupert Murdoch the $6.2 million in concessions he demanded.   \"Here to Stay,\" read the headline on page 1, beside the newspaper's familiar line drawing of its founder, Alexander Hamilton, who was smiling and flashing a thumbs-up sign.

They were among the world's first farmers and over hundreds of years had settled down in houses of some substance. At the same time, by adapting their basket-making technology, they began weaving crude fabrics, which are the earliest known examples of cloth ever produced.   Archeologists digging at the site in southern Turkey, a place known today as Cayonu (pronounced chi-O-noo), have found a fragment of white cloth wrapped around the handle of a tool made from antler. The material, about 1 1/2 by 3 inches, was preserved because it was semi-fossilized from contact with calcium in the antler. It is probably a piece of linen, woven from the fibers of the flax plant.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930713","time":"1993-07-13

Having heard that exercise can help maintain and even increase bone mass, they are walking, running, swimming, cycling and even lifting weights to ward off the fractures caused by osteoporosis.    But many exercise enthusiasts are not getting the benefits they think they are, recent studies indicate. First, not all kinds of exercise are equally beneficial to bone strength and some types may do little good. And second, exercise is but one of three crucial factors in maintaining healthy bones. The other two, an adequate intake of calcium throughout life and, for women at or past menopause, estrogen replacement therapy, complement the effects of exercise and may even be essential to its potential bone-building benefits.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930714","headline":"Judge Allows Stricter Rules on Emissions for New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/14/nyregion/judge-allows-stricter-rules-on-emissions-for-new-york.html","abstract":"  A Federal judge said yesterday that he was wrong in January when he barred New York State from adopting California's strict rules on air pollution from cars -- rules aimed at eliminating the kind of smog that blanketed the region last week.

But as it bizarrely happened, just such a tremor shook the West End on Monday. Hours before the opening of Mr. Lloyd Webber's \"Sunset Boulevard,\" the newspapers gave big play to the unexpected announcement that the West End production of the Broadway hit \"City of Angels\" would close after only a four-month run.    \"City of Angels\" received rave reviews, and its box-office collapse was blamed on the gravity of the recession and the declining sophistication of West End audiences. Since both \"Angels\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" happen to be about Hollywood in the late 1940's, the abrupt failure of the American show cast a particular pall over Mr. Lloyd Webber's gala premiere. Although \"Sunset\" boasts the cushion of a large advance sale -- at $:4 million ($6 million), neck and neck with a new revival of \"Grease,\" starring Debbie Gibson -- any visitor to its box office last week could discover that seats are readily available, as they are for virtually every West End attraction. No wonder, then, that The Evening Standard ran an editorial on Monday all but praying for the musical's success, reminding its readers that a \"smash hit show\" not only \"lifts our thoughts from humdrum, everyday toils\" but \"also draws foreign visitors to London.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930714","headline":"Traffic Alert","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/14/nyregion/traffic-alert-728593.html","abstract":"  TODAY   Broadway and Seventh Avenue will be closed between 42d and 47th Streets, from 11 A.M. to 2 P.M. for the presentation of \"On Broadway.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930714","headline":"Now Older and Wiser, Dickerson Starts Anew","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/14/sports/pro-football-now-older-and-wiser-dickerson-starts-anew.html","abstract":"  For 10 pro football seasons, Eric Dickerson's career has alternated between brilliance and turbulence.

Ball suggests we raise the Social Security tax on some beneficiaries (Op-Ed, July 2). This is the wrong solution for dealing with the deficit. If a larger proportion of benefits is taxed, the root causes of the deficit will still be ignored. Meanwhile, 4.5 million middle-income older Americans will experience an income decline, and support for Social Security could decline, not increase.   Mr. Ball advocates taxing Social Security benefits as we tax pensions. However, there are fundamental differences between the two. Social Security provides benefits that are intended as the base of retirement income. Less than half of those who receive Social Security also receive an employer-provided pension. For most of the middle-income elderly who would be taxed under the President's proposal, Social Security is the largest income source.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930715","headline":"Lords Turn Back Thatcher Revolt on Europe","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/15/world/lords-turn-back-thatcher-revolt-on-europe.html","abstract":"  Baroness Thatcher, who as Conservative Prime Minister gave only lukewarm support to European unity, broke openly with the Tory Government that succeeded her today to lead a revolt in the House of Lords, demanding a national referendum on the Treaty on European Union.
