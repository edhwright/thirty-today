For them, the dark days of winter spell months of emotional gloom and doom often accompanied by lethargy and an uncontrollable craving for carbohydrates, resulting in weight gain that makes them feel even worse.   For those with SAD, there is both good news and bad news. The good news is that the winter solstice has now come and gone, and with each passing day come more minutes of daylight. The bad news is that January and February are the worst months for people with SAD; although the days are gradually getting longer, these are especially cloudy months.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Health"},{"date":"19931229","headline":"Islanders Shut Out By Disney On Ice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/29/sports/hockey-islanders-shut-out-by-disney-on-ice.html","abstract":"  The game was one ignoble advertisement for themselves.

The hourlong program itself is divided between Palestinian and Israeli, with the first half given to the enduring leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who seems almost to have shaved for the occasion. Despite a little talk-show vaporing (\"But that's the dream that's never left you,\" Mr. Frost prompts Mr. Arafat about Palestinian claims to Jerusalem), the program does get into several prickly subjects.   On Jerusalem, Mr. Arafat, whose spotty English requires Mr. Frost to repeat some answers, proposes making the contested city the joint capital of Israel and a Palestinian state. For some reason, Mr. Frost does not elicit the Israeli Prime Minister's opinion of any such innovation. Nor does he ask Mr. Arafat about his intentions toward the Jewish settlements in Gaza, which Mr. Rabin maintains \"are going to stay; they are not going to be uprooted.\"   Although Mr. Rabin avows his commitment to successful negotiations, he does not exude as much confidence as his new television partner, who announces more than once, \"Where there's a will, there's a way.\" To one interesting question -- what would the newly organized Palestinian police force do if a Palestinian should shoot an Israeli -- Mr. Arafat replies, \"Sorry, we are not speaking about small issues.\"   Among the issues that Mr. Rabin does not consider small is whether, as Mr. Arafat holds, an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho represents the beginning of a Palestinian state or whether, as Mr. Rabin views it, the withdrawal is only \"an interim agreement that leaves the future open.\" They also disagree on which side will control the borders of the territories in question.   Both men assure Mr. Frost that they can manage the opponents among their own people to any agreement, but Mr. Rabin expresses skepticism about Mr. Arafat's ability to bring into line groups like Hamas, which are continuing to attack Israelis. The Prime Minister observes in his flat bass: \"They deny the right of Israel to exist. They opposed the very peace negotiations. They are against the agreement.\"   The two leaders display different styles. Mr. Arafat is more the showman; he speaks of himself as a martyr. Mr. Rabin is the Jewish Al Gore. But in their different ways, both leaven hope with wariness as they edge toward what Mr. Rabin calls \"calculated risks for peace.\"   Their appearance tonight makes plain, in case there was any doubt, that despite Mr. Arafat's waving away of what he calls \"small issues,\" the road to peace in the Middle East is still a minefield of details as well as principles.

It happened again tonight. After playing an inspired three quarters against the three-time defending champion Bulls and continuing their strong revival with a one-point lead, the Nets wilted during the final period when Chicago stopped toying with them, employed its powerful arsenal of Scottie Pippen and Toni Kukoc and burst to a 94-86 victory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931230","headline":"2 Quarterbacks, Many Questions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/30/sports/football-2-quarterbacks-many-questions.html","abstract":"  For two different reasons, the Oilers and the Jets were today pondering the decorum of playing or not playing their starting quarterbacks in Sunday's regular-season finale for both teams at the Astrodome.   The issue arose for the Oilers when Warren Moon cracked his ribs against the 49ers last Saturday. The Oilers have a playoff spot wrapped up, and if Buffalo loses to Indianapolis on Sunday Houston will have a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. If that happens and Moon doesn't play against the Jets, he could rest for three weeks and give his ribs time to heal. Oilers Coach Jack Pardee said today that Moon probably won't practice this week and that he will make a game-time decision on whether Moon will start. The Jets and Oilers will know if the game matters before the opening kickoff. Different Problem for Jets    Jets Coach Bruce Coslet reacted sharply when an article Tuesday in Newsday suggested that the team might decide to bench Esiason if the Jets are eliminated from the playoffs before Sunday's game. The reason: If Esiason increases his quarterback rating to 89 (it is now 87.1), the Jets will owe Cincinnati a second-round pick from the 1994 draft. That was one of the provisions of the trade that brought Esiason to the Jets from the Bengals in the off season. Coslet said Esiason will play \"every snap\" of the game, barring injury.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931230","headline":"Broken Homes, Mended Lives","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/30/opinion/broken-homes-mended-lives.html","abstract":"Does it make sense to spend money to keep troubled families together?

Both Mets and Orioles officials spent much of yesterday debunking reports that Bonilla was on the verge of being traded for Mike Devereaux, Baltimore's productive center fielder; David Segui, a first baseman who batted .273 with 60 runs batted in last season, and Brad Pennington, a hard-throwing left-hander who is 24 years old and had a 3-2 record with four saves in 33 innings with Baltimore.

But the Administration has decided to appeal only on technical grounds, to avoid broad constitutional issues that could undermine its new policy on gay service members.   The decision to appeal is part of an Administration effort to bolster its position against any challenge to the new policy. The ruling, handed down in November by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, involved a midshipman who was forced out of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis and not commissioned as an officer because he said under questioning that he was homosexual. Dealing With Old Policy    The court ruled that forcing him out violated the equal protection guarantee of the Constitution. The court was dealing with the old Defense Department ban on homosexuals, but its decision cast doubt on the Administration's slightly more liberal policy, which permits homosexuals to serve in the armed forces but only if they keep their sexual orientation a secret.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931230","headline":"U.S. Jews Don't Clamor for Spy's Release","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/30/opinion/l-us-jews-don-t-clamor-for-spy-s-release-237593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   American Jewish organizations, including rabbinical groups, have been urging President Clinton to shorten the sentence of Jonathan J.
