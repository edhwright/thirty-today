But a new study provides what researchers say is the first evidence that these birds, some of which are in decline, play a crucial role in maintaining the health and productivity of forest trees.   In the study, in the current issue of the journal Ecology, two researchers have shown that these voracious predators can protect trees by eating the bugs that chew the leaves. As a result, scientists are predicting that the decline of these birds could eventually threaten the productivity of forests in the United States as well as in the birds' wintering grounds in the tropical forests of Central and South America.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941108","headline":"Driver Tells How Gunman Fired at Van","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/08/nyregion/driver-tells-how-gunman-fired-at-van.html","abstract":"  The driver of the van that was raked with gunfire while transporting a group of Jewish students across the Brooklyn Bridge in March testified yesterday how he saw the defendant through the open window of his car and later picked him out in a police lineup.

The theory holds that modern humans evolved when areas of the cerebellum, the part of the brain just above the brain stem that controls movement, and frontal parts of the higher cortex both expanded. At the time, rudimentary connections between them also expanded, forming a unique circuit. This expanded circuit, which is not found in other primates or vertebrates, may have resulted from a mutation in one or more genes that help shape the developing brain, said Dr. Henrietta Leiner, who developed the theory a decade ago with her husband, Dr. Alan Leiner.

Both have done the reading before, but other well-known actors have also played Radner, who was in the original cast of \"Saturday Night Live,\" and Mr. Zweibel, one of the show's first writers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19941108","headline":"Republican Revolution: On the night of the 1994 United States midterm elections, Republicans make historic electoral gains by securing massive majorities in both houses of Congress (54 seats in the House and eight seats in the Senate, additionally), thus bringing to a close four decades of Democratic domination.","pages":[{"title":"Republican Revolution","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Revolution","description":"Series of wins by the Republican Party in the 1994 United States mid-term elections","thumbnail":null,"abstract":"The \"Republican Revolution\", \"Revolution of '94\", or \"Gingrich Revolution\" are political slogans that refer to the Republican Party's (GOP) success in the 1994 U.S. mid-term elections, which resulted in a net gain of 54 seats in the House of Representatives, and a pick-up of eight seats in the Senate.

As the last stone is put in place, \"Anchoress\" creates a chilling sense of entrapment while making the young woman's sense of relief and escape clear. Now she won't have to marry the reeve, the belligerent overseer of the manor where Christine, her sister and their parents sleep in a single bed in their thatched cottage. At times \"Anchoress,\" an eccentric, beautifully photographed black-and-white film, offers an eerie immersion in a distant world.    In his first feature, the English director Chris Newby deftly carries our century's attitudes about spiritual freedom and feminism into an artfully constructed past in which such attitudes came from the Devil. The story is based on scant historical references to the real Anchoress of Shere. Two letters written on a church wall in the English countryside tell of Christine Carpenter, who escaped from the world only to long for it again. The film's Christine (Natalie Morse) is like an emotional time traveler, a bridge between our attitudes and those of the 14th century.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941109","headline":"Manager's Dream Is Lost In the Sun","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/sports/baseball-manager-s-dream-is-lost-in-the-sun.html","abstract":"  Mike Easler came to Puerto Rico a couple of weeks ago to nurture his managerial aspirations in this island's winter leagues much the way he had nurtured his playing career during 10 winters of play here.

After winning the tie breaker, 7-2, the sluggish defending champion did just enough to take the second set at 6-4. \"I've had my better days,\" said Sampras, the world's top-ranked player, who is suffering from a throat infection. \"I feel depleted and I haven't eaten too much.\" Tomorrow, he will face Richey Reneberg, who defeated David Wheaton, 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (7-9), 6-1. Jaime Yzaga of Peru, seeded eighth, beat the German qualifier Arne Thoms, 6-2, 7-6 (7-1), ending a string of upsets that had sent two seeded players home on the first day. The tournament lost two top 20 players Monday when Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, seeded fourth, and Jason Stoltenberg of Australia, No. 5, lost in straight sets.

It is hard to say precisely why Operation Peddler Push in the 84th Precinct has succeeded in clearing the Fulton Mall of most of the illegal vendors without the kind of tension that accompanied last month's similar campaign on 125th Street in Harlem.

The consequences of the weak Democratic showing were particularly painful in New York State. It lost a Governor of great stature, Mario Cuomo, in favor of an untested newcomer, George Pataki. Mr. Pataki's promise of a sweeping tax cut poses a clear threat to New York City. Its Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, responded heroically to this threat with his endorsement of Mr. Cuomo. The first test for Mr. Pataki will be to show that he is not vindictive toward the city or the Mayor, and that he is independent of his political sponsor, Senator Alfonse D'Amato.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941109","headline":"Harper And Knee Listed as Doubtful","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/sports/football-harper-and-knee-listed-as-doubtful.html","abstract":"  The desperation pass that the Cowboys launched on the final play of the first half against the Giants on Monday night turned out to be riskier than expected.

Now, after $12 billion has been spent on new buses, cars and tracks, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has once again cut back the city's commitment to mass transit to cope with a new fiscal crisis.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941109","headline":"New York Congressional Races","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/nyregion/the-1994-elections-new-york-state-new-york-congressional-races.html","abstract":"  14th DISTRICT  Campaigning on Her Experience, Maloney Defeats Millard    Congresswoman Carolyn B.

Federal appeals courts declared both laws unconstitutional last year. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the ban on honorariums, part of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, violated Federal employees' First Amendment right of free speech. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, ruled that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was a Federal intrusion on state sovereignty for which Congress had failed to provide an adequate rationale.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941109","headline":"For Those Who Are Keeping Count","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/style/for-those-who-are-keeping-count.html","abstract":"FOLLOWING is a list of cookbooks still in print that have had spectacularly large sales.\n\nThe numbers, compiled in the last two weeks, are approximate because publishers are reluctant to release them.

Atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei, known as isotopes of the element. Two or more atoms can combine to form molecules. Some elements are formed from molecules of identical atoms, e. g. atoms of hydrogen (H) form diatomic molecules (H2). Chemical compounds are substances made of atoms of different elements; they can have molecular or non-molecular structure. Mixtures are materials containing different chemical substances; that means (in case of molecular substances) that they contain different types of molecules.

Just the damage NATO forces caused tearing around the German countryside cost $23.4 million then, and since unification in 1990 Germany has severely restricted ground and air maneuvers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"The Israeli Soldiers Who Must Not Fight","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/opinion/l-the-israeli-soldiers-who-must-not-fight-786888.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:    Your Nov. 3 news article recalls an incident from the late 1970's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"New York Results - The Race for Attorney General","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/nyregion/the-1994-elections-new-york-state-new-york-results-the-race-for-attorney-general.html","abstract":"              RPTNG.

But last week the Moscow-trained, rabble-rousing Mr. Meciar proved once again that while he cannot rule, he can still wreck. Just moments after the previous government resigned, he joined with parties from the far right and far left to railroad 13 measures through an all-night session of Parliament that sent Slovakia reeling back to the bad old days.   Mr. Meciar was never able to command more than 83 votes in the 150-member Parliament during the session. But with the opposition caught off guard and with only a simple majority required for legislation, he was able to do enormous damage to Slovakia's painful efforts to move toward a private economy and enlarge individual freedoms. In effect, he turned back the clock.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"In Line to lead: Senior Republican Senators","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/the-1994-elections-parties-in-line-to-lead-senior-republican-senators.html","abstract":"  Senators likely to lead Senate committees, based on their seniority.

Pataki set about transforming his campaign into a government yesterday, pledging to move quickly to enact the death penalty and a deep tax cut.    The extent of the challenge quickly became evident when Cuomo administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the state could face a budget shortfall next year of $4 billion or more. A gap of that size -- the state's general fund budget is $34 billion this year -- could make it exceedingly difficult for Mr. Pataki to deliver the first stage of his promise to cut income tax rates by 25 percent over four years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"THE 1994 ELECTIONS: PARTIES - THE OUTLOOK: As One Party Prepares to Run the Capitol, the Other Hunts for Leaders; Republicans Get Chance on Taxes, Crime and Welfare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/1994-elections-parties-outlook-one-party-prepares-run-capitol-other-hunts-for.html","abstract":"  The Republicans have left no doubt where they stand.

Mr. Silver, the quiet veteran state legislator from Manhattan's Lower East Side, will be in a position to shape and perhaps even block much of Governor-elect George E. Pataki's agenda.   Mr. Pataki's core campaign pledge, a 25 percent reduction in the state's personal income tax rate, must go for approval to the Democratic-controlled Assembly, which Mr. Silver leads, and to the Republican-dominated Senate. The coming battles over whether to approve the tax cuts, when to impose them, how to trim state spending and how to protect local communities from a loss of vital state aid, will all inevitably find themselves right on Mr. Silver's desk.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"F.A.A.

Bernstein's songs from this 1953 musical are as spirited as they ever were; the question is whether the show was always as campy and cliched as it was on Tuesday.    It's likely that even when it first opened to enthusiastic reviews, the show had a hint of camp, a hip humor based on a sense of superiority to the story's stock figurines. Bernstein and the lyricists had stepped in at the last minute to rescue a failing enterprise, and in cobbling this show together in four weeks they relied on character types for effect, leaning a bit on their earlier collaborative success, \"On the Town.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"Midwest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/the-1994-elections-state-by-state-midwest.html","abstract":"  ILLINOIS   Once one of the most powerful lawmakers in Congress, Representative Dan Rostenkowski was soundly defeated by a relative unknown, Michael P. Flanagan. Mr. Rostenkowski, an 18-term Chicago Democrat, was forced to relinquish the chairmanship of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee earlier this year after his indictment on corruption charges. Nonetheless, his defeat on Tuesday was considered a huge upset in the ward politics of Chicago, which in earlier times did not find indictments particularly troublesome.   As expected, Gov. Jim Edgar won a second term, trouncing his Democratic challenger, Dawn Clark Netsch.    In other Congressional races, one other Republican managed to win a seat that had been in Democratic hands. The district in Joliet that has been held by Representative George E. Sangmeister, a Democrat who is retiring, was won by State Representative Gerald C.

Pataki    Mr. Pataki, who will be New York's 53d governor, is the first Republican to be elected Governor since 1970 and the first without New York City roots since Nathan Miller of Syracuse 50 years before that. Like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Pataki, a 49-year-old State Senator who was an Assemblyman and a Mayor of Peekskill, inherits a politically divided Legislature that could be a check on his agenda. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR  Elizabeth McCaughey    If Mr. Pataki was the seasoned pol, Ms. McCaughey, who is 46 and lives in Manhattan, was the ticket's policy wonk. She was recruited from the confines of the Manhattan Institute. The Pataki campaign was short on substance, but state government revels in details. Will Ms. McCaughey be the brains behind the Pataki administration, or be left behind altogether when the guys get down to business? COMPTROLLER  H. Carl McCall    Elected by the Legislature last year to fill Edward V. Regan's unexpired term, the 58-year-old Mr. McCall survived the Republican sweep as the lone Democrat -- and the first black -- elected to statewide office in Albany. Typically, the comptroller is a naysayer, warning the Governor and Legislature not to spend what they don't have and berating them for past inefficiencies. New accounting constraints and his political independence may amplify his voice. ATTORNEY GENERAL  Dennis C. Vacco    As a former Federal prosecutor from Buffalo, he has promised to transform the office of Attorney General into a platform for changing the criminal justice system, and restoration of the death penalty has dominated his platform. But the job is considerably broader than that, and Mr. Vacco, who is 42, is largely untested as a consumer advocate and an architect of legislation within an attorney general's domain. ASSEMBLY SPEAKER  Sheldon Silver    As the Assembly Speaker, this 18-year veteran of the Legislature becomes perhaps the most powerful Democrat in the state. He is unabashedly liberal, resisting even some of Mr. Cuomo's more moderate initiatives. Moreover, as a New York City resident, representing the Lower East Side, he is likely to emerge as the city's chief defender in a state government that, presumably, will be less receptive to City Hall's legislative agenda. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER  Ralph J. Marino    The Senate majority leader, who was the chief Republican check and balance on the Cuomo administration, retains his seat, representing part of Nassau and Suffolk, and the Republicans kept their majority. But he may lose his leadership. Mr. Marino and his fellow Republican, Mr. D'Amato, are political rivals and he only grudgingly endorsed Mr. Pataki. Ambiguously, Mr. Pataki said only that he would not interfere when the Senate picks its leaders. SAM ROBERTS                    --------------------       Some Who Are Close to Governor-Elect    A representative, but incomplete, guide to those who have the ear of Gov.-elect George E. Pataki. MICHAEL FINNEGAN Former law partner, State Senate aide, campaign counsel, and old political friend. Is to Mr. Pataki what Peter J. Powers is to Rudolph W. Giuliani. UNITED STATES SENATOR ALFONSE M. D'AMATO Helped anoint Mr. Pataki with the party hierarchy, raised money and devised strategy for the campaign. In exchange, Mr. Pataki announced yesterday: \"You can call me, Al.\" CLARENCE D. RAPPLEYEA JR.  Known as \"Rapp,\" he was Mr. Pataki's mentor in the Assembly, where he is minority leader. A resident of the Southern Tier town of Norwich, the former stock car driver served as a campaign co-chairman and ambassador to upstate. JOE HOLLAND Harlem lawyer and entrepreneur who owns an ice cream parlor and founded a homeless shelter. Wanted to run for Attorney General but lost at the state Republican convention to Dennis C. Vacco, then played the good soldier by becoming co-chairman of the Pataki campaign. CHARLES GARGANO D'Amato fund raiser who helped Mr. Pataki raise $13 million, enough to outspend an incumbent Governor. LIBBY PATAKI The only Pataki adviser who the Governor-elect met while body surfing in a hurricane off Long Island. Wife and best friend since 1973. Mother of four little Patakis. Her first advice: take a vacation. He listened.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"G.O.P.'s Rising Star Pledges To Right Wrongs of the Left","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/1994-elections-leaders-gop-leader-gop-s-rising-star-pledges-right-wrongs-left.html","abstract":"  The former history teacher said it felt weird to be making history.

In recent years, Mr. Lubovitch's versatility has obscured his true calling, which is putting movement together with the mastery of someone who recognizes the passion of pure dancing. \"A Brahms Symphony,\" created in 1985, is a virtual surge of sweeping movement, while \"Fandango\" (1990) is the opposite, an erotic duet whose shapes are intricately pieced together, jigsaw-style.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"City Hospitals Avoid Layoffs And Make Severance Offers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/nyregion/city-hospitals-avoid-layoffs-and-make-severance-offers.html","abstract":"  Mayor Rudolph W.
