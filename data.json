Not even a brawl that left three Penguins and one Blackhawk ejected and halted the first period with 51 seconds remaining could stop Pittsburgh from beating Chicago at home for the first time since Dec. 6, 1988. The Penguins' record shutout streak ended at 187 minutes 30 seconds when Brian Noonan scored on the power play at 6 minutes 31 seconds of the third period with a shot between Barrasso's pads. (AP) SKIING Giant Slalom to German Katja Seizinger of Germany won the women's super giant slalom today in Shizukuishi, Japan, the final day of competition in the World Alpine Ski Championships. Seizinger, the World Cup downhill champion, covered the 1.35-mile Mount Kotakakura course in 1 minute 33.52 seconds to deflate the hopes of Austrian veteran Sylvia Eder. Eder, whose sister, Elfi, won a bronze medal in the women's slalom, got the super-G silver in 1:33.68. Astrid Loedemel got the bronze in 1:34.07, giving Norway its seventh medal of these ski games, one behind Austria. Norway still led with three golds to two for Germany, which got the first of this competition when Miriam Vogt won the women's combined.   The women's super-G was perhaps the most critical event of the championships. The start was pushed back 90 minutes by wind and blowing snow, and further delays would have imperiled the men's super-G, to be run on the same mountain three hours later.   On Saturday, Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway won the slalom for his third medal of the competition. He has won two golds and one silver in three races, making him the runaway big winner in the world championships. If the weather would cooperate, Aamodt had a shot at another medal today in the super giant slalom, the event in which he is Olympic champion.

Weder, who finished second in last weekend's two-man bobsled race, had a combined time of 1 minute 43.84 seconds. Austria's No. 1 sled, driven by Hubert Schoesser, finished the day in second place with a 1:44.06 clocking. The United States' No. 1 sled, driven by Brian Shimer of Naples, Fla., and the No. 2 German sled, with Harald Czudaj at the helm, tied for third place in 1:44.15. The final two-runs in the two-day event are scheduled for today on the Igls course, just outside of Innsbruck.

Today, Seles will face Martina Navratilova for the $75,000 first prize in the $350,000 tourney. Navratilova defeated Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-0, 4-6, 6-1, in the other semifinal. \"Against Seles, you have to earn every point,\" Fernandez said. \"Since she's been No. 1, she been just about unbeatable.

(AP) GOLF Hill Leads Seniors by 6  Mike Hill shot a sevenn-under-par 65 to take a six-shot lead yesterday after two rounds of the Challenge, a Senior PGA tournament in Naples, Fla. Hill holed a 75-foot putt on the 490-yard par-5 10th hole for an eagle. His hot round also included six birdies and a bogey. He birdied the 18th by hitting a 5-iron within 15 feet of the pin. Dave Stockton, the first-round co-leader, fell off the pace with a 71 to put him in the pack at six under with Gibby Gilbert, Jim Dent, Larry Gilbert and Mike Joyce.

On one night we had the duck hot with vegetables, and the following day we served the leftover meat with a frisee salad.    Duck breast salad makes an excellent first course, light supper or lunch dish, and it is at its best when the greens are chilled and the duck is still warm.

It is as much a compliment as a complaint to say that the show at Kraushaar (Fifth    Avenue at 57th Street, through Feb. 27) makes you wish that someone else, preferably a museum, would turn around and do it all over again, only bigger and more comprehensively.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930214","headline":"Virtuosi in Two Chamber Series","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/nyregion/music-virtuosi-in-two-chamber-series.html","abstract":"  CHAMBER music by Philharmonia Virtuosi brackets the week in Westchester, starting at 2 o'clock this afternoon when Richard Kapp, the music director, introduces Amy Lin, the prize-winning young pianist, who will join members of the ensemble in Janacek's \"Concertino\" and the Schumann Piano Quintet.

The diner retains its old-fashioned white tile floor, long counter and window booths in front. The main dining area (seating 24) is a carpeted, rather dimly lighted interior room with three booths, a few wood tables, black lacquered chairs, a pressed-tin ceiling and lemon and rust painted walls hung with paintings, prints and old photographs of Fairfield. Upstairs, an old-fashioned bar, with a huge stuffed marlin on one wall, has additional tables for dining.   The menu contains standbys like clams casino and scampi as well as certain new American concepts, some of which work, others not always with consistency. For instance, a starter of smoked ham and corn fritters in a mango vinaigrette sounded intriguing, but the reality lacked ham and the pool of sauce the fritters rested in tasted more like undiluted orange juice than mango. Despite the absence of smoked ham, the fritters were crisp, golden and tasty -- certainly among the best of the appetizers sampled. The plate also yielded a sharp, fresh-tasting chopped tomato-fennel sauce laced with raspberry vinaigrette. The sauce later surfaced as a garnish for chicken paillard.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930214","headline":"Special Tools Help Drywall Installation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-special-tools-help-drywall-installation.html","abstract":"  GYPSUM wallboard is a nearly ubiquitous building material.

They are the counterparts of their better known and more touristic cousins in the heights above Nice: St.-Paul de Vence, Vence, Tourrettes-sur-Loup. Built in the Middle Ages, with a history dating back before Jesus, they have names like Seillans, Bargemon, Fayence, Callian, Figanieres. Some of their sinuous lanes, most of them closed to cars, are barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. Still paved with their original cobblestones with a middle gutter for the rainwater, they twist and sharply climb the slopes of the rock on which they cling. Hiding behind their ramparts, the villages, built to fend off the attacks of the dreaded Moors, strangely evoke the medinas of Morocco. Most have kept their 10th- or 11th-century castles intact, with a chemin de ronde still circling under the ramparts.   Of course, this region has been discovered, mostly by English lovers of Haute-Provence, and Scandinavians and Belgians keeping their secret quiet. They have bought the medieval village houses and castles and renovated them into three- or four-story vacation homes full of character, with breathtaking views over the surrounding mountains. Fayence, Seillans and Bargemon have been partly gentrified, yet they are still deeply Provencal, involved in the production of olive oil (cold-pressed, the best you'll find in the South of France), essential oils from jasmine and lavender, and the famous Rose de Provence, which you can taste and buy at the vineyards in the surrounding valleys. If you time your visit in late winter or early spring, when the mimosa blossoms burst into a vibrant yellow along the quiet roads, you will catch a glimpse of an authentic Provence the summer tourist can barely see.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930214","headline":"Real Incest and Real Survivors: Readers Respond","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/books/l-real-incest-and-real-survivors-readers-respond-621793.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Frequently incest survivors, like war veterans and torture victims, suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. One of the symptoms of this syndrome is the obliteration of the memory of the trauma. This repression is actually a coping mechanism that allows children to survive the terror of their past. Dennis Charney, a neuroscientist, found that trauma actually alters the chemistry of the brain. Studies report that the average age of remembering childhood incest is between 29 and 49. It is for this reason that the statute of limitations for reporting abuse was extended in Washington State.   \"Is such legislation warranted?\" Carol Tavris asks. Many critics of our legal system believe we do more to protect the accused than the victims. According to an article written by Heidi Vanderbilt for Lear's magazine, eight of our states have no incest statutes. Twenty-seven states deem vaginal penetration necessary for incest to have occurred. Thus a father who sodomizes his child or forces him or her to perform fellatio would not meet the legal definition of incest.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930214","headline":"Denise Brine, F.

But Nobel prizes are both political and literary. Why should India, with a literary tradition longer than Japan and the Americas combined, have only Rabindranath Tagore as a laureate? On the other hand, why should Ireland, with a population not much bigger than Connecticut and tiny in comparison to the world population of Latin American writers, have birthed three laureates: Samuel Beckett, George Bernard Shaw and William Butler Yeats?","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930214","headline":"The 45, Hole and All","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/style/thing-the-45-hole-and-all.html","abstract":"  WHAT: The seven-inch single.

They're cheap, about $2 to $5 apiece. And they're eminently collectible.

During the years Nicholas Boyle examines, Goethe proved himself a multifaceted genius -- he became not only a writer but also an artist, scientist and public administrator. This first volume of a two-part biography is \"replete with penetrating insights and unsurpassed in thoroughness,\" Christoph Schweitzer said here in 1991.

(Anchor/Doubleday, $11.) The third volume in this Nobel laureate's trilogy continues the story of the family of al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, a Cairo patriarch. In this novel, first published in Arabic in 1957, al-Sayyid Ahmad, a symbol of the old Egypt, has grown elderly and embittered; it is up to his grandchildren's generation to shape a new and independent nation. Last year our reviewer, Ammiel Alcalay, said: \"The ordinary nature of Mr. Mahfouz's world, with its willingness to confront the complexities of human intentions, makes it an extraordinary exception in a marketplace of manufactured ideas and is, for that, all the more admirable.\" Anchor/Doubleday has also issued a new paperback edition of Mr. Mahfouz's 1967 novel MIRAMAR, translated by Fatma Moussa Mahmoud, edited and revised by Maged el Kommos and John Rodenbeck ($8.50).

When a foreign film is remade to suit American audiences, its new version inevitably reflects some perception, fair or otherwise, of American tastes. We are seldom forced to contemplate those tastes as bluntly as we are by \"Sommersby,\" a post-Civil War version of \"The Return of Martin Guerre\" (1982), and \"The Vanishing,\" a Hollywood remake of the identically titled 1991 Dutch thriller. If we set out to commission a collective self-portrait, we would surely want something a bit more flattering.   The contrasts between these new films and their European predecessors are particularly fascinating because the originals are so quietly contemplative (and so good). On the trip across the Atlantic, reflectiveness has been one of the first things to go. American audiences are presumed to want more action, more explanation and more literal-minded detail to spell out the characters' inner thoughts.

It is fun to browse through the more than 350 photographs of now-familiar celebrities as they looked 20, 30 or 40 years ago.

Kurri snapped the scoreless tie at 4 minutes 42 seconds with his 23d goal, beating Kirk McLean to the glove side from about 30 feet. With the goal, Kurri tied Bryan Trottier for 14th place on the career goal-scoring list at 520. Jimmy Carson followed with his 27th goal, a 25-footer through a screen.

Her adherence to \"the best defense is a good offense\" school worked well for her; Spassky could not quash her dynamic, aggressive maneuvering and was pretty much hamstrung with White.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930216","headline":"Sports of The Times; The Rangers Celebrate Kiddies' Day","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/16/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-rangers-celebrate-kiddies-day.html","abstract":"  THERE were so many youngsters being escorted into Madison Square Garden that you half expected them all to be twirling flashlights in the darkness and watching the Flying Gutkowskis or some other daredevil circus act.

It is his first new book to appear in 125 years.   Thoreau scholars consider the newly titled \"Faith in a Seed,\" which combines his \"Dispersion of Seeds\" with other late natural history writings, a major contribution to American literature and a reason to revise traditional thinking about his life. Because of its trail-blazing scientific material, they say, it adds a whole new chapter to the understanding the author of \"Walden,\" \"A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers,\" \"The Maine Woods\" and \"Cape Cod.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930216","headline":"Brazil Seeks to Revive Its Economic Miracle, Lying in Ruins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/16/world/brazil-seeks-to-revive-its-economic-miracle-lying-in-ruins.html","abstract":"  Outside a grim municipal building on the west side of this city, scores of men, women and children line up every evening.
