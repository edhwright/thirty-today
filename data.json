Even countries unmoved by Israel's concerns about Islamic terrorism should recognize that any effort to press for the immediate return of all 396 by imposing sanctions would be excessive and counterproductive.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930203","headline":"Arts Groups Step In to Fill the Gaps","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/03/education/arts-groups-step-in-to-fill-the-gaps.html","abstract":"  The decline of arts education in the classroom has motivated an honor roll of public institutions and private groups to fill the void.

The structural recession is characterized by a reversal of the usual cause-effect sequence. Layoffs, especially at high wage levels, are its main source rather than its result.   The two recessions interact: a cyclical downswing in 1990, combined with drastic cuts in defense spending and with growing global competition, have acted as catalysts to accelerate the restructurings of the workplace.

It was introduced at the 1990 world championships, and gives a prize for overall performance in a series of minor games at a tournament. This is now being tried in American tournaments, and the Continuous winner at the Tri-State Regional Championship last month was Joan Dziekanski of Manhattan, who works at the Beverly Club.   On the diagramed deal she held the East cards, with her husband, Paul Dziekanski, in the West position. Her opponents bid themselves to one no-trump when outnumbered in high-card points, a risky thing to do when vulnerable.   A heart lead to the ten was won by the queen, and South led the spade nine. West made a good play by putting up the jack, leaving South to wonder about the location of the queen. South might have won with the king, in the hope of scoring five tricks in the suit, but made the right decision by ducking.   West cashed the diamond ace, looking for a clue, and was not sure about the meaning of his partner's four. He tried the club nine, and East took the ace and returned a heart. West took two heart tricks and now worked out that his partner held diamonds. He shifted back to diamonds, and the defense took eight tricks without South's having to judge what to do in spades.   The moral is that light third-hand opening bids are risky when vulnerable. Most experts would choose to open with the North hand, but if they fail to find a spade fit they can expect to suffer the same fate as North-South did: minus 200, the kiss of death in matchpoint play.

Slide Hampton's 12-piece orchestra, which provided many of the musicians for the United Nations Band led by Dizzy Gillespie last year, is presenting a memorial tribute to Gillespie this weekend. It features Mr. Hampton's arrangements of Gillespie's music, and the group includes one of the legendary trumpeter's most celebrated trumpet-playing followers, Jon Faddis, as well as the trumpeters Claudio Roditi and Roy Hargrove. The trombonists are Steve Turre, Douglas Purviance and Mr. Hampton; the saxophonists are Jimmy Heath, David Sanchez and Antonio Hart, and the rhythm section is made up of the pianist Danilo Perez, the bassist George Mraz and the drummer Lewis Nash. The band will be recorded tomorrow and Sunday by Tel-Arc Records. Sets are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; there is a $15 music charge and a $10 minimum. A New Sextet     The Warren Vache-Ken Peplowski-Howard Alden-Dan Barrett Sextet, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785.

There is little doubt that Mr. Vache's cornet, Mr. Peplowski's clarinet and saxophone, Mr. Alden's guitar and Mr. Barrett's trombone give the group an unusually solid foundation for success, particularly with the support of Michael Moore on bass and Billy Hart on drums. Their challenge will be to train audiences to remember all those names. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9, 11 and 12:30; Sunday, 9 and 11 P.M. only. On all three nights, the music charge is $15 and the minimum, $6.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930205","headline":"Kidnapper Killed in Trap Set by Victims' Relatives","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/05/nyregion/kidnapper-killed-in-trap-set-by-victims-relatives.html","abstract":"  It began as a kidnapping and armed robbery on a Chinatown street, an increasingly common crime in communities with large Asian-American populations.

Careful study of any one of the sometimes seductive, often chaotic, commercial venues housed within New York museums can resemble a close encounter with the institution's most intimate thoughts and fantasies, about both itself and its public. In short, today's museum shop is rife with conflicts and desires, and they're not all coming from the shoppers.   Museum shops have always mirrored their parent institutions, but they've come a long way since the reflection consisted primarily of exhibition catalogues and posters, postcards of works in the collection and relevant art books. For some time now, major museums have emblazoned their logos on tote bags and umbrellas, and have been developing other more creative ways to capitalize on their holdings and cachet.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930205","headline":"G.M.

Already reeling from more than $10 billion in losses in the last seven quarters and the resignation last year of its chairman, Robert C.

In today's rock sound, voices survive within the anarchy of noise. The classic singer's stance, pushed up to the mike, overriding the guitars' dominance with wit and vigor, gives way to a deeply articulate quietism. Singers like Roxanne Stephen of Th' Faith Healers and Sarah Shannon of Velocity Girl never force their way to center stage, preferring to ride the junk-filled stream of their bands' music, their voices sometimes bobbing to the surface like lost treasure. Th' Faith Healers, who come from England, claim influence from outlaw progressive rockers like Can; the group's cacophony resolves into rich tones that pique the imagination.  Velocity Girl is part of the newest wave of American independents, and brews a gentle storm of dreamy melodies and feedback. The bands appear together tonight, sharing the bill with fellow groundbreakers Fuse and Prison Shake. Tickets are $9, and the first band goes on at 10 P.M. Bob Marley's Birthday     Bob Marley Day Celebration, the Ritz, 54th Street and Broadway, (212) 541-8900. Bob Marley remains a hero to progressive music lovers of all stripes, and his physical absence, now in its 12th year, hasn't shaken the power of his influence.

Also not to be missed is new video of Marley, collected by Roger Steffens. It should be a righteous night of jamming, which reggae lovers will dedicate to a friend and leader whom they'll never forget. Tickets are $20 for general admission or $27 for reserved seating, available at the Ritz box office or through Ticketmaster.

But the disease has had a major impact in areas where those groups -- homosexuals, drug users, the poor and the undereducated -- are concentrated, like New York City, the study said. Strikes the Powerless    The study said groups with greater power remain relatively unaffected while AIDS \"is burrowing into socially disadvantaged segments of our society that may be ignored by the general population and by public policy.\" As a result, it said, there is the danger that attention may wane and that \"the disease may become accepted as one of the 'synergy of plagues' endemic in vulnerable communities.\"    AIDS \"will 'disappear,\" the council concluded, not because, like smallpox, it will have been eliminated, but because those who continue to be affected by it are \"socially invisible.\"   Thomas Brandt, an official of the National Commission on AIDS, said the report was \"on the mark\" because \"there has not been an appropriate level of response\" in America.   \"Many segments of society have not changed, but they need to,\" he said. \"While America will never be the same, some of our core institutions are continuing to do business as usual.\"   Among the study's conclusions about the extent of the effect of AIDS on social structures were these:   *Initially, public-health officials set aside conventional containment practices, like quarantine and mandatory testing, and developed control methods involving education. As the AIDS epidemic enters its second decade and settles firmly in minority groups, public-health officials are returning to more traditional practices, including screening to detect H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Education efforts, the study said, have resulted in wider acceptance of \"safe sex,\" including the use of condoms.   *Although AIDS has put a great strain on health-care resources in some communities, most areas have been able to absorb the new patients. About 2 percent of the nation's health expenditures are consumed by AIDS, and the disease has caused two health-care changes -- increased efforts to protect the nation's blood supply and a reassessment of ethical concerns among health-care workers treating patients with lethal infectious diseases.   *AIDS has instilled a new sense of urgency in developing and testing drugs and has led to fewer restrictions on testing drugs developed to compbat lethal diseases.   *Widespread voluntary action arose from the gay male population, which was most severely affected early in the AIDS epidemic. But as the epidemic becomes more centered in the poor communities, the resources of voluntary actions may grow smaller. Panel of 11 Experts    The National Research Council is part of the National Academy of Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress to provide scientific advice to the Federal Government. The study was compiled by a committee of 11 experts and reviewed by organizations within the academy.   \"In the panel's judgment,\" the study said, \"the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic has affected many transient changes in the institutes we studied and relatively few changes that we expect to be permanent.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930205","headline":"Nets Return From Land Of the Big Blown Lead","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/05/sports/pro-basketball-nets-return-from-land-of-the-big-blown-lead.html","abstract":"  If the Nets want to be respected as contenders this season, they must beat elite teams like the Seattle SuperSonics, who came into tonight's game tied for the league's third-best record.
