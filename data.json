KSFO's previous format (only four months on the air) was not one of failed \"young, liberal talk hosts.\" With few exceptions, the format was void of any point of view at all. The Fabulous Sports Babe and Dr. Laura Schlesinger (both in the old lineup) are hardly the spiritual leaders of the American left wing.   While KSFO believes its listenership is up, it hasn't tapped into any new audience. KSFO's owner, KGO (San Francisco's top-rated station), has been catering to the right-wing market for years. They are simply shifting listeners from their more successful property to the lower-rated one.   My own experience as a \"young liberal talk host\" at KSFO indicates there is an untapped market for talk radio. Target the millions who grew up listening to music on FM radio. The mostly AM talk format accounts for roughly 20 percent of the radio audience. Should we assume this means the other 80 percent have no opinions? The FM listeners want talk radio that provides entertainment, information and a lot of laughter.

As I report in \"An Eye for an Eye,\" the camps in Poland in 1945 weren't for Nazis but for German civilians, of whom less than 1 percent were ever indicted as Nazis. Many were children.   You refer to a review of \"An Eye for an Eye\" by the German critic Eike Geisel. Mr. Geisel wrote that I come from \"the school of sadistic sensationalism,\" and to prove it he quoted parts of the German edition of \"An Eye for an Eye.\" But neither I nor my German translator ever wrote what Mr. Geisel quoted. Incredibly, Mr. Geisel himself rewrote a part of the German edition to convey a sadistic sensationalism that he then attributed to me.   Many camp commandants in Poland (and nearly all the directors in Warsaw) were Jews, and Mr. Geisel wrote that my message is \"Jews equal Nazis,\" is Jewish and Nazi criminals are \"mirror images.\" That isn't my message at all.   I specifically write in \"An Eye for an Eye\" that the Jews and Nazis \"of course . . . hadn't done the same things at all,\" and that I would never contend that the Jews and the Germans \"were equivalent, even morally.\"   Instead, I write of Jews like Zlata, Moshe, Mania and Pola, who refused to look at, much less to work at, the Polish camps. I write of Jews like Shlomo Singer, who at the risk of his life told people who tortured the Germans, \"You must stop doing this,\" and of Jews like Lola Potok, a commandant, who at first took revenge on the Germans but then, at the risk of her life, protected them, even smuggled them food.    At the end of \"An Eye for an Eye,\" I write, \"I do believe it's a story of Jewish redemption.\"   Again incredibly, Mr. Geisel isn't a right-wing but left-wing critic, though surely the German right wing is now parroting him and saying that Jews equal Nazis. It is tragic that \"An Eye for an Eye\" is not being published in Germany now and that Germans have nowhere to learn the truth.

Newspapers in France and in Britain reported today that a senior intelligence officer in the Algerian Army was shot to death with two bodyguards and his driver on Sunday in an Algiers suburb. There was no official confirmation of the killing, but he would be the highest-ranking officer to be slain by militants since a military-backed coup set off an Islamic revolt there three years ago.   Islamic militants have also taken responsibility for blowing up three vital bridges in and around Algiers and killing at least 11 well-known figures in the arts and civil affairs in the last week. Among them were the director of the national theater; a composer of rai, an Arab music with a fast beat; and a leader of the feminist movement.   So far the oil industry, crucial to the country's flagging economy, has been spared. But diplomats and experts on Algerian affairs say the security situation seems to be spinning out of control, raising the prospect of an all-out guerrilla war involving big armed clashes across the country, including the capital.   European governments -- particularly that of France, which as Algeria's former colonial ruler has a large population of North Africans -- are expressing nervousness and confusion over the rapid deterioration in security. France's President, Francois Mitterrand, urged the Government this month to negotiate with the help of European mediators, but the Algerian leadership rebuffed that notion as outside interference in its affairs.   Diplomats say the ouster of Algeria's military-dominated Government could profoundly undermine the Governments of neighboring Morocco and Tunisia, leaving Europe to face a phalanx of Islamic states just across the Mediterranean modeled politically after Iran.    Europeans also fear the possibility of an influx of frightened middle-class North African migrants averse to the idea of living under Islamic rule.   Underlining those worries, Algerian militants carried out a virtually unparalleled raid on a border post in neighboring Tunisia last week, killing seven guards. The Armed Islamic Group, one of the most violent of the Algerian factions, took responsibility for that attack today.   In tracts distributed in Algiers, the group said the cross-border raid was a \"warning\" to Tunisia's staunchly secular Government to \"stop helping the enemies of Islam.\"   The violent revolt in Algeria began in early 1992, after a military-backed Government seized power and canceled a final round of elections that the Islamic movement seemed sure of winning. The new leadership banned the Islamic political movement and imposed severe limits on civil freedoms like public gatherings and writings critical of the Government.   Since then, clashes between secularists and Islamic militants have taken at least 30,000 lives, with security officers, Government officials, foreigners and, now, secular cultural figures among the main targets.   But the death toll last week, which began to surface in Algerian newspaper reports only today, represents a striking acceleration of the attacks.    French and Algerian analysts said the number killed last week exceeded 500 people, including militants, soldiers, urban civilians and Berbers in the mountainous Kabyl region in the north, where opposition to the fundamentalist campaign is strong.   The latest spate of large-scale attacks in the capital began with a suicide bombing on Jan. 30 near a police headquarters downtown that killed 42 people and wounded 256, mostly innocent civilians and pedestrians.   Often it takes several days to piece together events in Algeria. Few foreign journalists operate there because of the threat to their safety, and the Algerian Government often withholds information on rebel attacks and military operations.   The senior military officer reported killed on Sunday was Col. Mrawi Jilali, a ranking army intelligence officer responsible for issuing reports to the public and news organizations. According to several Algerian officials, he was one of the closest aides to the intelligence division's chief, Gen. Tewfik Madani, whose movements are a closely guarded secret.   The killing suggested that the fundamentalists are refining their sources of information and their infiltration of circles of the country's top leadership. Opposition figures said Colonel Jilali was under surveillance for three days before the shooting in the Kouba district, on the edge of the capital.   In December, Islamic militants took their war to France, hijacking an Air France jetliner from Algiers to Marseilles and killing three passengers before French commandos stormed the plane and killed the hijackers.    For the French Government, the most alarming aspect of the hijacking may be that intelligence officials now suspect that Iran helped instigate it .   In an article this week in the French weekly Paris Match, a former journalist and novelist, Gerard de Villiers, reports that French intelligence officials are saying that Iran has linked up with Islamic militants in Algeria \"on an operational level,\" lending advice and support.   Mr. de Villiers quotes French anti-terrorist intelligence officials as saying that early in December, weeks before the Christmas Eve hijacking began, Iran's minister of secret and intelligence services, Ali Fallahian, met with representatives of the Islamic Armed Group, the Palestinian organization Hamas and the Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon known as the Party of God. All three groups are militantly Islamic in their orientation and receive advice and financial backing from Iran.   Mr. de Villiers wrote that French intelligence agents were tipped off about the meeting, which took place in Tripoli, Lebanon, by Syrian counterparts who watch Lebanon carefully.    Until recently, French intelligence believed that Algerian militants received some training in Iran and in the Sudan and some financial support. But the meeting in Lebanon appears to have taken relations to a higher level.   Last month, France's confusion over what to do about Algeria was evident. President Mitterrand's call for talks between militants and the army to end the conflict broke with a French policy of supporting the Algerian Government in its effort to eradicate militants. Mr. Mitterrand was immediately contradicted by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who said the war was an internal Algerian affair.   Nonetheless, the attacks on vital targets in Algiers have shaken confidence among French officials that the Algerian military can still control the situation in the country of 30 million, where unemployment runs close to 40 percent. The economic misery helps the militants' drive to recruit volunteers to overthrow the Government.   Among the three vital bridges blown up in and around the capital in the last two days was one linking a neighborhood where the army headquarters and main armed forces hospital are located.   Any lingering hopes that the Government might renew a bid for negotiations with jailed leaders of the Islamic opposition have faded somewhat with reports in a London-based daily that the movement's leader, Abassi Madani, who was moved from house arrest to a military jail this month, has undergone an operation to remove a serious cancerous growth from his gums or jaw. The Algerian Government has not confirmed the report, which appeared in the Arabic-language paper Asharq Al Awsat.   Mr. Madani was moved from house arrest to a military jail earlier this month. It is not clear under what conditions he has been held following the surgery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950222","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/nyregion/news-summary-901195.html","abstract":"  International A2-9  AGREEMENT ON MEXICAN AID  The United States and Mexico agreed on a $20 billion rescue plan for Mexico.

Calling the action a first installment on their promise to balance the budget by 2002, Republicans approved cuts in job training and education, assistance to homeless youths and veterans, foreign aid to Russian republics, money for United Nations peacekeeping operations and Federal subsidies to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. - If they stand, the cuts approved by five subcommittees today -- and those to be made by eight other panels in the next few days -- will eliminate many of the social programs that conservatives have criticized as wasteful and redundant.   But the Democrats, with President Clinton in the forefront, have already begun to fight back, and many of the midyear cuts in the 1995 fiscal year budget are expected to run into resistance in the Senate, which will not take them up until the House has completed its work.   After a strategy session with Democrats on Capitol Hill today, Mr. Clinton emerged to lambaste the Republicans for a proposal to replace the Federal school lunch program in the budget for the 1996 fiscal year with block grants to the states, calling it \"a terrible mistake.\"   The most influential of the subcommittees -- Labor, Health, Human Services and Education -- proposed cutting $4.3 billion, affecting 142 programs, including 84 that were marked for elimination.   Among them were dozens of youth-training and education programs, like the Clinton Administration's Goals 2000, which sets national standards for secondary education. The Republicans would also reduce the $3.5 billion Head Start program by $105 million, eliminate $1.3 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program that provides fuel oil to the needy and would mark for termination a host of grants, like the National Science Scholars ($4.4 million) and the Javits Fellowships ($7.5 million).   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting's $285.6 million budget was not marked for cuts this year, but in 1996 its budget would be cut by 15 percent, or $47 million, with an additional $94 million, or 30 percent of its current budget, pared in 1997. Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said, \"It represents the first whack in what the Speaker has said will be the total elimination of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950223","headline":"A Chance for Peace in Ireland","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/23/opinion/a-chance-for-peace-in-ireland.html","abstract":"  The Governments of Ireland and Britain have taken a bold step toward peace in Northern Ireland.

Mr. Clinton needs to shore up his support with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., now meeting in Florida. No surprise, then, that he flirts with intervening in the baseball strike and threatens to veto pro-management bills making their way through the Republican-controlled Congress.   There is logic, too, in using a Presidential order to get some movement on an economic issue that is important to both business and organized labor. Last year, the House passed a blanket ban against allowing companies to hire permanent replacements for striking workers. The measure died in the Senate, where Republicans and some Democrats rightly viewed it as too sweeping. Businesses have the right to stay afloat during a strike, just as workers have the right to seek other jobs. But that can be done in almost all strikes with temporary replacements. No one's career is ended; the damage to both sides is short-term.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950223","headline":"Putting Safety First : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/23/opinion/IHT-putting-safety-first-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding the report \"Lufthansa Faces Boycott After Barring Rushdie\" (Feb. 15):.Salman Rushdie writes for a living.

They approach the keyboard like warriors, with fierce, determined energy and finely honed technique. The Irving S. Gilmore International Keyboard Festival may help produce another genre of pianist: one who is erudite, unorthodox and introverted. The Gilmore Artist is chosen every four years by 15 members of an advisory committee who tour the world and, unannounced, listen to concerts by every major contender. The winner does not pursue the prize. Rather, a modest career must already be in progress, a musical maturity already in evidence, before the prize -- $115,000 and $400,000 in management services -- begins to pursue the pianist.    That new genre now includes Ralf Gothoni, who became a Gilmore Artist last February and made his New York debut in the Miller Theater on Tuesday night. Like the first Gilmore winner, David Owen Norris, Mr. Gothoni is in his 40's. He has had a professional career for nearly 30 years, as a soloist, recitalist, chamber musician and conductor, and has made about 70 recordings.

He became patriarch and confidant to generations of painters, among them Cezanne, who called him \"le bon Dieu,\" by which he meant a kind of genial god.   It's revealing that Pissarro served this function, as he was, in several senses, an outsider. He was a Jew, and this was during the era of the Dreyfus Affair (a fact not lost on the anti-Semitic Degas, who slighted his former collaborator even while Pissarro continued to champion Degas's art). Pissarro was also born and reared not in France, but on the Caribbean island of St. Thomas. And he was an anarchist.

From our colleague Joyce Purnick comes an account of the Giuliani administration's new punitive press policy. It seems Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his press secretary, Cristyne Lategano, have been vetting articles to see who has been naughty and who has been nice. Based on their new Giuliani-friendly rating scale, Ms. Lategano will dispense interviews and information to reporters who are sufficiently uncritical. City officials who want to follow American officeholders' two-century tradition of talking to reporters when it will serve the civic interest are being told to clam up.   This, of course, is an approach that will backfire on the Mayor and blight Ms. Lategano's own budding career. But that is their business. The challenge for reporters and editors is to respond professionally to the administration's unprofessional behavior. Mayor Giuliani is not the first politician to try to turn reporters into boosters, simply one of the more clumsy. He is very likely under the sway of some of his more paranoid retainers. Perhaps his thinking will clear up when he realizes that he will succeed only in diverting attention from his accomplishments.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950224","headline":"No Dynamic Davis Cup Duo","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/24/sports/no-dynamic-davis-cup-duo.html","abstract":"  Don't expect to see Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi volunteer for Davis Cup Dream Team duty any time soon.

The downsizing of corporate and public America has forced hundreds of thousands of people into early retirement, or into starting their own businesses. Either way, this usually eliminates future savings for a long while and accelerates withdrawals from existing accounts.   Even the most generous severance packages force most people who are victims of mergers or other downsizing to live on less over an extended period of time.   While the retirement age is slowly being increased to 67 and there is talk in Congress of advancing it to 70, the boomers should be very cautious as they approach age 50. They should be less concerned whether Social Security payments will be there for them and more concerned with saving enough to survive if they too become early victims of the bottom line. BEN A.

The solitary sculpture in his show here consists of two chunks of marble. One is a roughly octagonal column of mottled gray-brown stone, toppled on its side and held off the floor by glass marbles scattered beneath it. At one end of the column, the faceting gives way to an oval cylinder. The second piece of marble sits atop the other end: a slab of pink-white stone with semi-circular ridges carved into one side and the other side left unfinished. The words \"Il Giorno mi pesa sulla notte\" (\"The day weighs on me at night\") are inscribed on the edge of the pink slab facing the head of the toppled column.   The piece as a whole is intentionally unprepossessing: neither a traditional composition nor a raw chunk of nature. It can be read as an illustration of the inscription: the horizontal column would be the recumbent artist, and the semi-circles of pink marble would represent the dawn of day, literally weighing on him. But once you start in with the metaphorical readings, it's hard to stop. If you're not careful, the piece as a whole begins to look rather like a large snail: the brown column is its body, and the pink slab is its shell. At this point, the piece begins to look silly. This is presumably not the artist's intention, although with Mr. Fabro, who once exhibited a pair of marble feet emerging from shantung silk trousers, you can never be too sure.

In Mr. Rohmer's newest film, \"The Tree, the Mayor and the Mediatheque,\" which has its first American screenings at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center today and tomorrow as part of the series Cahiers du Cinema Selects Recent French Film, the fate of the proposed center rests upon the subtle interaction between a Government official, a conservationist and a journalist.    The village's rich, well-meaning Mayor wants the center to be built, but he is fiercely opposed by a local schoolteacher who is incensed that its construction would necessitate destroying an ancient tree that is a natural landmark. The Mayor and the teacher are interviewed by an ecologically sensitive journalist who understands all sides of the issue.
