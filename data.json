Otherwise it may soon face economic sanctions for its noncompliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    Pyongyang's obstinacy may leave President Clinton no choice but to press for limited economic sanctions through the United Nations. But in doing so he needs to hold open the door to diplomatic dialogue, which is the only way out of his, and North Korea's, nuclear predicament.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940322","headline":"Somalia's Faction Leaders Agree to Form an Interim Government","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/22/world/somalia-s-faction-leaders-agree-to-form-an-interim-government.html","abstract":"  Somali faction leaders agreed today on the formation of an interim government and said they would sign a \"declaration of national reconciliation\" on Tuesday, a United Nations spokesman said.

Both bills have a valuable core: $22 billion to put more police into communities, cope with bulging prisons and provide a smidgeon of support for prison drug treatment and other preventive programs.

Characters are voluptuous, even when the realities of their existence are ominous and harsh. In this atmosphere, a wife responds amorously when her husband embraces her, even though she happens to be busy scrubbing the floor.   Ms. Zauberman uses this intoxicating manner to tell the story of Abraham (Roma Aleksandrovitch), his family and his neighbors, who reflect varying political changes that are in the offing. Nachman (Rolan Bykov), Abraham's grandfather, is the estate manager for a brooding, world-weary Prince (Oleg Iankovski) who presides over the region until his money runs out.

A study of pedestrians at a busy intersection in Los Angeles found that 27 percent of elderly people who began to cross as soon as the light flashed 'Walk' were unable to reach the opposite curb before the light changed against them. At least one-fourth of those who were unable to cross in time were left stranded by at least one lane of traffic, according to a report in the current issue of The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.   In the study, Dr. Russell E. Hoxie and Dr. Laurence Z. Rubenstein of the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine watched 1,200 people trying to cross a street in an area where a lot of older people live. They found that all the younger pedestrians, who walked at an average speed of 1.27 meters a second, managed to get across the street in time. But among older pedestrians, whose walking speed averaged 0.86 meters per second, only 73 percent crossed in time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940323","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/23/nyregion/c-corrections-554383.html","abstract":"  A picture caption yesterday about Congressional maneuvering over the question of hearings into the Whitewater land dealings of the Clintons referred incorrectly in some copies to a man shaking hands with Representative Lee Hamilton.

There is no excuse for the board not to have set a better example, for schoolchildren and for other agencies in the city.    The Council passed a law in 1989 that requires 25 percent of the city's average daily waste stream to be recycled. Mandatory recycling by city agencies was instituted in 1990. An audit that year estimated that the city's 1,069 schools generate 120,000 tons of waste annually, or about 3 percent of its non-residential garbage. Of the total waste produced by the schools, the auditors concluded, 33,000 tons could have been recycled.

Clearly defined men and women moved through glowing light, dressed in simple clothes that would clearly never pass muster with any self-respecting high-fashion designer. Lilting Chopin issued from a piano to the left of the stage, accompanying the performers through dances from Jose Limon's lyrical \"Mazurkas.\"   There were reassuring doses of angst and rigorous abstraction to come. Limon, who died in 1972, had his feet firmly planted on the ground and his eyes turned upward. But this first program of the Limon Dance Company's two-week season at the Joyce opened a door -- through \"Mazurkas\" and an eloquent performance of the Limon classic \"The Moor's Pavane\" -- onto a different world than that of the brainy, stylish, hyperactive modern dance of the 1990's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940324","headline":"Italy's Knight in Teflon: Tycoon Repulses Charges","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/24/world/italy-s-knight-in-teflon-tycoon-repulses-charges.html","abstract":"  The candidate had been touching the bases -- the soccer set in Milan, the disco set in Rome, the homemakers, the aristocrats, the Chief Rabbi.

The work was commissioned by the orchestra, and the performance was its world premiere.   Mr. Ge was born in Shanghai in 1954 and began his training there, completing it at Columbia University. Like Bright Sheng, Chen Yi and Tan Dun, composers with similar biographies, Mr. Ge comes to Western instrumentation and compositional forms with fresh ears. His rhapsody alludes to Chinese timbres, most notably in occasional sliding string figures and in passages for wood blocks. Chinese propulsive techniques are used, too: in one particularly moving section, a solid, full-orchestra chord is repeated at an increasing tempo, an effect drawn from Chinese opera.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940324","headline":"One by One, Marquees Light Up As Spring Comes to Broadway","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/24/theater/one-by-one-marquees-light-up-as-spring-comes-to-broadway.html","abstract":"  It's almost April, and as sure a sign of spring as any is that old bear Broadway, lumbering out from under its snow blanket and blinking itself awake just in time for the Tony Award nominations. Winter, always the sleepiest time of the Broadway season, has been especially so this year, with the biggest news -- \"Show Boat\" ushers in the $75 ticket! Glenn Close replaces Patti LuPone in \"Sunset Boulevard\"! -- concerning shows not due until fall. And as has been the pattern the last several years, the season's final month will be its busiest, with 12 shows opening before the Tony deadline on May 11, beginning tonight with \"Carousel\" at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center.   Up to now, what kind of season has it been? Well, not too good. The consensus, in the words of Alan Wasser, the general manager of three Broadway musicals, is \"it's been slow, no question, both in terms of production and in terms of attendance.\" As in the last few seasons, he said, \"you reach March and nothing much has happened, and then there's a handful of things coming in that everyone pins their hopes on.\" Signs of Hope    Nonetheless, there are some positive notes. All but 2 of Broadway's 35 theaters have had or will have a booking this season. And despite the worst winter weather in memory, compared to the situation last year at this time, the number of total productions is up (to 24 from 19), attendance is about even (right around 6 million) and total receipts, more than $266 million, are up slightly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940324","headline":"Parcells Seeks a Giant Look","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/24/sports/pro-football-parcells-seeks-a-giant-look.html","abstract":"  Bill Parcells is not only trying to acquire current Giants players, he is also going after some former Giants as well.
