Mondale, the American Ambassador here, today took the unusual step of going on national television to apologize for the killing over the weekend of two Japanese students in Los Angeles and to counter Japan's growing certainty that the United States is a nation of gun-wielding maniacs, unfit for tourism or study.   Yet to millions of Japanese, the scene from a Los Angeles suburb -- a late-night carjacking, two 19-year-olds shot in the head -- seemed so horrifyingly familiar that no one bothered to describe America with the usual Japanese term: a \"gun society.\" This time, it was just assumed to be the case. No Arrests    The police in San Pedro, a section of Los Angeles near Long Beach, said they had no suspects and few leads in the case. The two students at Marymount College in nearby Palos Verdes had pulled into a shopping center at 11 P.M. on Friday and were apparently shot as they got out of their car. The car was later found a few miles away.

Now teachers, they still live in a tiny apartment in Beijing more suited to students than adults, and are stymied about the future. Xiaodong is an intense-looking man, with large glasses and a roomful of paints and canvases. But as the narrator says, \"He dreamed of nothing but being rich,\" and the fantasy paralyzed him. \"He couldn't even paint.\" Xiaochun is so ready to leave the relationship and the country that she writes to relatives in New York and hopes to join them.   The film is most intruiging when it becomes a window on aspects of Chinese culture rarely depicted on screen. Some early-morning sex between Xiaodong and Xiaochun is discreet by American standards, but the scene is long and emphatic enough to be unusual in a Chinese film. And at times \"The Days\" effectively suggests the tension between an awful past that the characters want to forget and a present that seems cut off from all meaning. Xiaochun's parents had been persecuted by her entire school when she was 16. There is no need for the film to belabor the point that when she finally goes to New York, she writes to Xiaodong without reference to their life together.

Now a growing band of scientists working in a young field called chemical ecology is focusing on the extraordinary diversity of chemical languages found in the animal and plant kingdoms. They are studying chemicals that alarm, chemicals that seduce, chemicals that repel, chemicals that persuade. They are learning that for any single species, the vocabulary of chemicals can be extremely rich, capable of telling an individual not just where a potential partner may be found, for example, but whether that partner is a virgin or a vamp, an industrious provider with food to share, or a loser whose cupboards are bare.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940329","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/29/sports/transactions-611123.html","abstract":"  Baseball American League  BALTIMORE ORIOLES -- Purchased the contract of Lonnie Smith, outfielder, from Rochester of the International League and assigned him to the 40-man roster.

The embryos that contained the mutant gene were allowed to die; one of the normal embryos was implanted into the mother's womb, and she gave birth to a healthy baby.   In another case, a so-far-healthy member of a family with a history of Huntington's chorea, which cripples and kills its victims in middle age, volunteers to have doctors search his body for the culprit gene.

Gaye, an internationally popular singer, songwriter and musician who died on April 1, 1984, a day before his 45th birthday, is remembered by many as a handsome, sultry soul balladeer. But he was also recognized as a recording-session drummer, a gifted instrumentalist, the first artist associated with the Motown label to begin producing his own albums and a performer concerned with spiritual matters. Rock singers like Mick Jagger and Rod Stewart were influenced by his singing and several of his songs, including \"Sexual Healing\" in 1983, were perhaps the most overtly sensual popular music recordings of their time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940330","headline":"For Pat Metheny, Silence Is Awful : The Sound Under The Sound","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/30/style/IHT-for-pat-metheny-silence-is-awful-the-sound-under-the-sound.html","abstract":"Pat Metheny's \"Zero Tolerance for Silence,\" released this week by Geffen, is a well titled album.

Mr. Olafsson, in a telephone interview on Monday, sounded disconcertingly normal, not like the humorless overachiever you might expect. He made it clear that the mean-spirited protagonist of \"Absolution\" was not an autobiographical creation. \"He can be a very unpleasant human being and my goal was to make him so untrustworthy that you couldn't believe anything he said,\" Mr. Olafsson said. \"But I also wanted to make him complex enough that you would sympathize with him, despite his shortcomings.\"   Mr. Olafsson has also finished a play called \"Four of Hearts,\" which he said was about \"four old guys playing bridge\" and which is to be produced in Iceland soon. He plans to finish a short novel by the fall. And then he intends to embark on his next long novel, set in the years after World War II. It's no wonder his wife likes to joke that his favorite Friday night consists of a good meal, a bottle of wine and the chance to fall asleep 10 minutes into a rented movie.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940330","headline":"Review/Film; The Great, Big Worries of Such a Tiny Girl","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/30/movies/review-film-the-great-big-worries-of-such-a-tiny-girl.html","abstract":"  If there is an underlying message in Don Bluth's animated musical, \"Hans Christian Andersen's 'Thumbelina,' \" it is that nice little girls with big dreams should stay as far away from show business as possible. The parade of characters who try to manipulate and possess Thumbelina (Jodi Benson), a tiny 16-year-old girl who springs magically from the center of a flower, are a rogue's gallery of unwholesome show-business types. When not ogling and pawing the thumb-size girl, they promise her a grubby, compromised notoriety on the lower rungs of the show-business ladder.    In Mr. Bluth's freewheeling cinematic adaptation of the popular 19th-century story, Thumbelina is plunged into a nightclub netherworld the night after she meets and falls in love with the fairy prince of her dreams. The scenes of their courtship, in which her dream lover, Cornelius (Gary Imhoff), flies them around on a bumblebee and the dancing couple glide and dip like an Olympic figure-skating team, are among the movie's most captivating.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940330","headline":"The Spin on China Trade : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/30/opinion/IHT-the-spin-on-china-trade-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"The machine in action: The Clinton administration has privately decided, it appears, to drop its contrived links between human rights issues and preferred trade status.

It would convert a 750-bed medium security prison into a treatment center for alcoholic and drug-addicted prisoners, many low-level drug dealers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940331","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/31/arts/classical-music-in-review-632007.html","abstract":"  Kurt Ollmann  Baritone Weill Recital Hall   Kurt Ollmann's recital on Tuesday night made for a bewildering prospectus on paper: songs of Ives, Poulenc, Jacques Leguerney, Richard Rodgers, Aaron Copland and a clutch of contemporary American composers.

Our research demonstrates that those who make large contributions to Congressional candidates (and whose economic and legislative interests line up neatly with PAC inter- ests) provide more money to these candidates than PAC's do. In 1992, large individual contributions made up 35 percent of the total given to Congressional candidates, compared with 29 percent from PAC's. When you include Presidential candidates, large individual contributions ($375 million) dwarf PAC contributions ($180 million) more than two to one.   When you add large contributions from business-connected individuals to PAC contributions from the same businesses, the grand total dwarfs the next largest source of money -- labor -- by six to one. (If you compare PAC totals only, the ratio is three to one.)   PAC and large individual contributions together maximize the political clout of business. Our research shows this is true for every category of business, particularly health care, insurance and finance. Furthermore, the profiles of members of Congress who eschew PAC contributions, taking only contributions from individuals, show economically interested funding patterns virtually identical to those who accept PAC contributions.   Framing the campaign finance reform issue as a PAC issue encourages narrowly drawn \"reforms,\" which are more likely to freeze into place the worst aspects of the system or even make it worse. If we want real reform, which addresses the conflicts of interest and disenfranchising inequalities inherent in private financing of public elections, we need to understand the source of that financing. And that source is not just PAC's. ELLEN S.
