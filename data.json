The original drugs had many unpleasant side effects, from dizziness and painful dry mouth to weight gain and sluggishness. Doctors, too, were uneasy about the potency of the pills, and thus prescribed the medications for short courses, up to nine months maximum.   Many doctors say they are comfortable keeping their patients on the newer antidepressants for long stretches. They say the drugs are safer than the older generation of pills, are almost impossible to overdose on, have fewer side effects and work wonderfully for patients who were difficult to treat before, including those who suffer from panic disorders, anxiety attacks, bulimia, anorexia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.    Yet the medical portrait of Prozac and related compounds emerging from years of use among millions of patients is not a simple sunburst of unfettered success. The drugs bear their own disturbing consequences and question marks, particularly in their long-term risks. Some doctors worry that, with all the pep talk surrounding the novel antidepressants, the trouble spots are being ignored and the pills being presented as the pharmacological equivalent of a Snackwell fat-free cookie: a chance at bliss without paying the price. 'Deceptively Easy'    \"Drugs like Prozac are so deceptively easy to take and tolerate that they can excuse a physician from respecting the complexity of depression,\" said Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.    But that has not stopped some patients. Rebecca L. Morgan of Monaca, Pa., has been on Prozac for three years, since she was 27, and she has no intention of quitting, ever. The drug is the flagship member of a new fleet of antidepressants, and it has transformed her life. Before Prozac, she could not keep a job for more than a few months at a time. For the past year and a half, she has been a counselor for the mental health association in Beaver County. Before Prozac, she suffered five episodes of major depression, during which she could hardly drag herself off her couch or feel enough to realize she was miserable. Now, she still has emotional peaks and troughs, but when she is faced with an adverse event, she does not slide into a depression as she says she would have in the past.    \"I don't know what the long-term effects of the drug are,\" she said, \"but if 20 years from now they say it affects the kidneys or the lungs or whatever, I'm willing to pay the price. Prozac helps me now.\"   Ms. Morgan is not alone in embracing Prozac as a permanent therapy for the chronic problem that is her melancholic nature. Since Prozac was introduced five years ago, its popularity has soared to tropospheric heights. More than 10 million people have taken the drug worldwide, earning for its maker, Eli Lilly & Company, about $1 billion a year. Many other people are using even newer, chemically related drugs called by the trade names Paxil and Zoloft. And while most remain on the medications for less than a year, a sizable minority are staying on the drugs for two years or longer.  Drugs Are Specific    Much of the relative safety of the new class of drugs, called serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, lies in their biochemical specificity. The original antidepressants, introduced in the 1950's and known as the tricyclics and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, jiggle multiple biochemical pathways in the brain and reconfigure the balance of several different types of signaling molecules, or neurotransmitters. By comparison, Prozac and its cousins zero in on one neurotransmitter, serotonin, brightening mood and lessening anxiety by keeping pools of the chemical available in the brain for nerve cells to use and reuse. Greater specificity in the nervous system means fewer side effects throughout the body.    Nevertheless, some researchers warned that serotonin is a muscular chemical and that manipulating it even with exquisite specificity is bound to reverberate in unexpected ways. Although early fears that Prozac may occasionally initiate violent or suicidal behavior have not been supported by extensive clinical studies, new studies show that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors have a more severe impact on sexuality than at first estimated, causing symptoms like impotence, an inability to ejaculate, an inability to reach orgasm, a loss of sensation in the vagina, and an all-round loss of interest in one's erotic affairs.    \"The early studies on this suggested an incidence of about 2 percent, but that was based on self-reporting, from the patients,\" said Dr. Peter Kramer, author of the best seller \"Listening to Prozac.\" \"When researchers went out and vigorously interviewed people, they found 40 percent had some sexual dysfunction.\"    Another common side effect of the new antidepressants that had been underemphasized until recently, said Dr. Brian Doyle, director of the Georgetown Anxiety Disorders program, is sleep disturbances. Perhaps a third of Prozac users suffer severe insomnia, and some who manage to fall sleep report excessively vivid dreams that can verge on nightmares.   For those Prozac users in whom insomnia becomes unbearable, some doctors prescribe small doses of, oddly enough, the older tricyclic antidepressants, which can be sedating. But physicians never mix the serotonin re-uptake inhibitors with the monoamine oxidase inhibitors; that combination can be extremely dangerous, causing rigidity, rapid fluctuations in vital signs, extreme agitation progressing to delirium, coma and even death. Drugs Fail for Some    Researchers also warned that the serotonin compounds do not work for 20 percent to 40 percent of depressed or anxious people who try them, the same failure rate seen with the older antidepressants. Some patients say they find drugs like Prozac disorienting or too amphetamine-like in their properties, causing problems in concentration and memory.    Apart from known side effects, the risks of taking any antidepressant drug for years is not yet clear, for the simple reason so far no one has taken the drug for very long. In studies with mice and pigs, Canadian investigators have found that antidepressants can act as tumor promoters, hastening the growth of nascent malignancies. These preliminary results have yet to be confirmed by others, and there is no evidence to suggest that antidepressants contribute to cancer in humans, but some researchers admit that the long-term risks remain to be gauged.    Because women suffer a disproportionate rate of depression and thus are more likely to be takers of Prozac, a few studies have looked at the effect of the antidepressants on pregnant women. So far, researchers have seen no increase in birth defects from the drugs, but women who take any sort of antidepressant drug, including Prozac, have about twice the rate of miscarriages during the first trimester of pregnancy as do women not on the medications.    Nor can researchers be sure that exposing a fetus to a drug capable of altering the balance of neuronal signaling molecules does not have a subtle impact on the brain that only shows up years later, say, as a learning disorder. In addition, a nursing mother on Prozac may transmit traces of the medication to her infant, again with unknown effects. Long-Term Treatment    The trend toward treating recurrent depression as a chronic disease, deserving of long-term, if not lifetime treatment with antidepressants, is likely to accelerate, doctors said.   \"Eighty to 90 percent of people who had one episode of depression will have another,\" said Dr. David Kupfer, a professor and chairman of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. \"That realization makes me much more aggressive. People need long-term treatment, and we need to figure out the best strategy.\"   But some researchers observe with concern that the drift toward extended drug regimens is occurring in parallel with another trend: prescribing antidepressants for people who are not really depressed. Prozac is now being given with some regularity to patients diagnosed as \"dysthymic,\" jargon for perpetually crabby, under the weather, insecure, malcontent.   \"Dysthymia has less of a biological feel to it\" than does full-blown depression, said Dr. Doyle of the Georgetown Anxiety Disorders program. \"There's not as much of the sleep disturbances or the appetite problems. These are people who realize they're more unhappy than the situation calls for, and that meditation, exercise, talking to friends just doesn't do the trick.\"   As it turns out, Dr. Doyle said, many dysthymics do very well on Prozac and its chemical siblings, finding in the drugs a brightening of mood that therapy sessions alone may have failed to bring.    But whether the syndrome is a true disease is a matter of considerable debate among doctors. And to some critics, the idea of people who are not really sick taking potent psychiatric drugs for months or years is a sobering prospect indeed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931213","headline":"MOROCCO TO WIDEN LINKS WITH ISRAEL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/13/world/morocco-to-widen-links-with-israel.html","abstract":"  King Hassan of Morocco has decided to broaden his country's economic cooperation with Israel in a major step toward the eventual normalization of relations, senior Clinton Administration officials say.

But most people who marry hope and expect children to be born to them. We are willing to expend enormous amounts of love and attention and care as well as money to raise capable and healthy offspring. Surely, giving some thought to their genetic load is not misplaced (\"Nightmare or the Dream of a New Era in Genetics?\", front page, Dec. 7).   Dor Yeshorim, an Orthodox Jewish program using advanced molecular technology to screen young people considering marriage, was formed to enhance the effort to have healthy children by sparing potential partners the agony of conceiving genetically defective children. With increased medical research, there are many more conditions that can be prevented than Tay-Sachs disease.   While ethicists agonize over some people's being marginalized as marriage partners, they would do better to focus on the fact that medical conditions not manifesting themselves until middle age do not make them benign or pleasant to live with.   Very few of us are interested in spending much effort to maintain good health. Rather, good health is seen as a birthright. And while it is true there are many common conditions that do not compromise actual life, they do not enhance it either and many sufferers would prefer a less flawed genetic endowment.   Dor Yeshorim's purpose is to allow potential marriage partners to establish in advance of emotional involvement whether or not a relationship should be pursued. For those with multiple problems, presumably a pool of potential partners can be identified with whom normal children can be produced. Prevention beats remediation any day.

Under current law, many battered immigrant women must depend upon their abusive spouses to initiate a petition for legal status on their behalf. Abusers frequently refuse to file this petition, instead using their absolute control over their victims' ability to live and work in this country to perpetuate abuse and force women and children to stay in violent relationships.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931214","headline":"French Rescuers Defend Italy Yacht's Decision to Call for Aid","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/14/sports/IHT-french-rescuers-defend-italy-yachts-decision-to-call-for-aid.html","abstract":"The French crew that went to the aid of the stricken Whitbread Italian entry sprang to its defense on Monday, dismissing reports that the Italians had activated a distress beacon before their lives were threatened. .Crew members of La Poste, the French","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931214","headline":"3 Heroes Recall Amtrak Disaster on a Bayou","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/14/us/3-heroes-recall-amtrak-disaster-on-a-bayou.html","abstract":"  Three men whose heroism was credited with saving scores of lives in the worst wreck in Amtrak's 22-year history vividly recounted today the chaos in which 47 people died when their train plunged into an Alabama bayou this fall.

The report revealed signs of abuse and neglect that went unchecked, including bruises a coroner found on Ms. Stalker's chest, abdomen, shoulder, back and thighs and an untreated bladder infection so serious that it caused bleeding. The autopsy concluded, however, that Ms. Stalker died of natural causes and no criminal prosecution followed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931214","headline":"Debate on Benefit Of Breast Screening","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/14/science/debate-on-benefit-of-breast-screening.html","abstract":"  Experts disagree on the benefits of using mammograms to screen women under 50 for breast cancer.

In an early scene, the members of an impoverished farming family solemnly take turns dipping their ladles into the single bowl of watery soup that is their only meal of the day. Later in the film, scores of villagers numb with despair and hunger huddle silently in the pouring rain outside a Government office until a truckload of armed soldiers arrives to disperse them.

Narrative is the engine for the eccentric surges of movement and for the unexpected twists and turns that go with it. The vocabulary may be symphonic, but the syntax is not. Berlioz's colleagues built pieces of music; he himself imagined characters and situations and set music in pursuit of them.   Indeed, it is the unevenness of \"L'Enfance du Christ,\" which Roger Norrington, the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus brought to Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday, that creates much of its charm. Part 1, given over to King Herod's anxious dreams and the Slaughter of the Innocents, is opera pure and simple. In the first of many pictorial strokes, Roman sentinels pace to bass pizzicatos.
