In signing off, the series stays true to its original purpose -- of taking an affectionate, sardonic look at growing up suburban in the late 1960's and early 70's.   The last episode finds the show's protagonist, Kevin Arnold (played by Fred Savage), now 17 years old, angrily quitting a summer job at his father's furniture factory and leaving town on what he imagines will be an odyssey of self-discovery. What happens is summed up by the show's narrator -- Kevin himself, some years hence -- thusly: \"Things never turn out exactly the way you planned.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"Jane G.

The company has long been known for its inventive stagings and impressive casts, mostly drawn from the ranks of young singers. For ticket or other information, the number to call is (212) 408-1661.   Christopher Beach, director of the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York at Purchase, has started a 10-year plan to produce Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas with first-rate soloists, full orchestra, and a professional chorus.

While he occasionally dabbled in subjects outside his chosen field -- the Bible, say, or the works of William Shakespeare -- he took his self-imposed burden seriously.   No one knew better than Asimov how quickly books about science become obsolete. Even those written from a historical perspective have a relatively short half-life. Twice between 1964 and 1982, Asimov updated his comprehensive Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, revising and adding hundreds of entries; the 1982 edition offered a sampling of \"The Lives and Achievements of 1,510 Great Scientists From Ancient Times to the Present Chronologically Arranged.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"Democracy's Obsolete Secrets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/opinion/democracy-s-obsolete-secrets.html","abstract":"  President Clinton has ordered a sweeping review of government secrecy now that the cold war is over.

Its emergency room treats more than 39,000 cases a year.\n\nDr. Glantz, 37, had the right qualifications, of course, but it was also his easygoing nature and sensitive and jovial bedside manner that he extends to co-workers, as well as patients, that made him boss of the E.R.  Dr. Glantz entered the field 10 years ago, when physicians in emergency rooms were still the Rodney Dangerfields of medicine. They got little, or no, respect not only from other physicians, but also from the public. \n\nBut the field was already changing from one populated by many residents, semiretired doctors and those not able to succeed in their chosen fields to high-quality board-certified physicians trained in emergency medicine. E.R.'s were moving from being subsections with little authority to full departments with real power.\n\n\"While I still get asked sometimes when I'm getting a real job,\" said Dr. Glantz, who works 10-to-12-hour shifts three of every six days, \"this has become one of the hottest residencies now.\" \n\n\"We're no longer low man on the totem pole,\" he said. \"It is also one field where doctors don't have to wear beepers or be on call. And I get plenty of vacation, six weeks a year.\"\n\nDr. Glantz had originally wanted to be a surgeon, but he grew to love the action, variety and times when seconds count and the adrenalin surges in emergency medicine. \"I wouldn't do anything else,\" said Dr. Glantz, whose face is lightly freckled and whose brown hair is beginning to gray. \"I don't know how private doctors do it. I'd be bored to tears.\" \n\nIn emergency medicine, doctors have to know something about everything, he said. In one day he might have to treat a head injury, stabilize a heart-attack victim, set broken bones and deliver a baby on a car seat.\n\n\"But every time I get cocky enough to think I can handle everything,\" Dr. Glantz said, \"something comes through the door that we don't understand. It keeps me studying.\"\n\nDr. Glantz's days vary dramatically. Sometimes, business is slow, and just a few of the 22 beds are occupied. \n'We're Very Superstitious' \n\n Sometimes the ambulances never stop arriving. Like that cold winter night in 1990, when an Avianca jet crashed a few miles west of the hospital, sending a stream of ambulances carrying 11 trauma victims, five of them children. Or when the Walt Whitman Mall fire in 1991 sent to the hospital 22 smoke-inhalation victims and one burn victim, who later died.\n\n\"We're very superstitious,\" Dr. Glantz said. \"We follow the moon. Actually, Mondays after holidays are usually bad, and summer is worse than winter, because weekend warriors are some of our best business. And beer and lawn mowers are a terrible combination. We had a guy in here who ran over his foot with one. He had a Meisterbrau in one hand and a lawn mower in the other. True story.\" \n\nThree women arrived in the emergency room in one month, each complaining of unspecified abdominal pain and each in labor. \"One of the women even had other children,\" Dr. Glantz recalled. \"Now that's real denial, when you are in labor and don't even know you're pregnant.\"\n\nOn a recent Monday, which was slow, Dr. Glantz was tending a man who had a grand mal seizure at a friend's house and was taken by ambulance. The man, who had a history of seizures, was using medication to control them, but had forgotten to take it that morning or even for a few days. It was difficult for Dr. Glantz to get a straight story. He hears lies daily, he said, but he does not grow angry, because patients usually lie out of embarrassment.\n\nHuntington Hospital does not treat the same populations as many urban hospitals, but the community has changed dramatically in 20 years.\n\n\"Long Island is no longer a bedroom community, where everyone is a homeowner with a two-car garage and 2.4 kids,\" said Dr. Glantz, who grew up in Rosedale and earned his B.S. in chemistry at the State University at Stony Brook in 1977. \"Now we have the Saturday night knife-and-gun club. We get slashings and knifings and shootings. Not as much as Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, but we get our fair share, if there is such a thing as a fair share.\"\n\nJust after noon on that Monday, a young man accompanied his 12-year-old cousin, who had an earache. After a quick look at the boy's ears and throat, Dr. Glantz found the problem.  The right ear was bright red, a sure sign of an infection. Dr. Glantz told the boy about the eardrops and bubble-gum-tasting antibiotic that he would prescribe and shook his hand, but he gave no hint to the youth or his cousin that children's ear infections belong in a pediatrician's office, not in an emergency room.\n\nDr. Glantz was well aware that the boy, like an increasing number of people in the region, is in the Medicaid program. In the Huntington region, he said, there are virtually no physicians who treat Medicaid patients, because of the paperwork.\n\n\"The nearest clinic that takes Medicaid is pretty far away, in Wyandanch,\" he said. \"And they are so swamped that this boy probably would not have been given an appointment until next week. Others have no health insurance at all. We're the safety net here. No one is turned away, which is one of the beauties of emergency medicine. I can treat everyone equally, from the homeless to someone from Lloyd Harbor who pulls up in a Rolls- Royce.\"\n\nSuddenly a mother carrying a baby who was bleeding from the head rushed in. The woman explained that her car had skidded in Dix Hills and hit a tree. The windows on the driver's side shattered, and the baby, Jake, was in his car seat at the time.  \"Well, that's good,\" Dr. Glantz said. \"Now let's take a look at him.\" \n\nAs the mother let go, Jake began to cry. A nurse took off his diaper, which had glass shards in it. The mother winced and kissed the baby, who was five days away from his 1st birthday. She, too, started to cry. \"He may have just been hit by some flying glass,\" Dr. Glantz said. \"And that would be good.\" \n\nHe held a pen in front of Jake's face and told him to watch the rocket ship.  \"See it come out of mommy's ear,\" he said, as he checked the baby's pupils to see whether his brain was functioning properly. \"Kids respond better when I act like a silly uncle.\"\n\nAn hour later Dr. Glantz was looking at X-rays of Jake's head and chest. \"Looks good,\" he said. \"Now I get to reassure the mom. That's what I like to do.\" Her son needed several stitches. But before Dr. Glantz could sew the cuts on Jake's forehead he had to perform another operation, something that he called \"a parentectomy,\" or removing the parent from the room. \"I have always found that the child does better when the parent is not in the room,\" he said. \n\nWith a large bright light overhead, Dr. Glantz put Jake in a blue papoose, which the baby did not like. Jake began to cry. \"I'm sorry, Pumpkin,\" Dr. Glantz cooed. He injected a local anesthetic, checked for glass in the wounds and began stitching with a tiny curved needle. \"This is where the art of medicine comes in,\" he said, as he sewed nine tiny stitches across two small cuts. He cleaned the baby's head, which was red from numerous scrapes, and dabbed bacitracin on the area. \"So do you hate me?\" Dr. Glantz asked as he took Jake out of the papoose. Jake stopped crying.\n\n\"Now we're buddies?\" Dr. Glantz asked. \"Give me five! Two and a half?\" Dr. Glantz carried Jake to his mother, singing to him all the way.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"Kristin Thompson, Christopher Bonacci","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/style/engagements-kristin-thompson-christopher-bonacci.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Richard L.

Stieglitz photographed Mrs. Norman repeatedly in the two decades before his death in 1946. They had met in 1926, in his small but influential domain, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue, where she was entranced by a John Marin exhibition.

Though the Freer stands in the shadows of Washington's other renowned museums and has a reputation for being a somewhat forbidding place, it has always had its ardent fans. Historically, it has the distinction of being the first American public collection devoted primarily to the art of Asia, though its holdings are what make it unique. \"America Meets Asia,\" the working title for the reinstallation, says it all.

But the old-style barbecue has undergone many changes since the fashion for it first swept the nation in the 1940's. The current status symbols are gas grills that cost half as much as a car, flavored wood chips, exotic marinades and fancy salsas. And as Americans look for food that is low in fat and calories, without preservatives, sugar or rich creamy sauces, so the search for new flavors and ingredients continues.   As noted last week, Oriental seasonings -- soy sauce, sesame oil, fresh coriander -- do a great job of enhancing the taste of grilled foods, especially seafood. I like to buy shrimp in Chinatown, where they are sold with their heads on, and soak them for a couple of hours in heavily salted ice water, which leaches out impurities. They are then patted dry and tossed in a mixture of peanut oil and black and red peppers with garlic. Cooking them in their shells concentrates their flavor -- and the shells can also be eaten, if you like.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"Fresh Air Fund Hosts Prepare for a New Season","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/nyregion/fresh-air-fund-hosts-prepare-for-a-new-season.html","abstract":"KEISHA THOMAS had always gone to summer camp, but last year her mother, Yvonne Owens, could not spare the money for it.

It would be easy to compile a damning list of callow tenors, worn sopranos, uneven casts, dull conductors, misjudged theatrics, neglected opportunities.   But the Met's track record this season was actually one that any company in the world might envy. It included the revival of a 1964 production of Verdi's \"Falstaff\" in a sterling performance that almost made it seem as if Paul Plishka, Marilyn Horne and Mirella Freni were part of a polished repertory company -- alert to one another and to the score. Otto Schenk's new production of Wagner's \"Meistersinger\" was suffused with good sense and exceptional ensemble work; its Nuremburg included Hermann Prey, Donald McIntyre and Karita Mattila. To my ears, \"Die Walkure\" was the musical standard-bearer for the Met \"Ring,\" and the Met orchestra played it nearly seamlessly.

This travel fantasy, like many, proved too time-consuming to realize. When I finally got around to making my trip, I found myself with just one free day. To attempt such a pilgrimage in so short a time is of course folly, but having waited so long, I was determined not to cancel. How much Shakespeare, I wondered, could I fit into a single day in Stratford? Dusk was settling over the town as I arrived in my rented car that Friday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"The Connoisseur of Disappointment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/books/the-connoisseur-of-disappointment.html","abstract":"THE STORIES AND RECOLLECTIONS OF UMBERTO SABA\n\nBy Umberto Saba.\nTranslated by Estelle Gilson.\nIllustrated. 222 pp. Riverdale-on-Hudson, N.Y.:\nThe Sheep Meadow Press. $22.50.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"In the Region: New Jersey; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/realestate/in-the-region-new-jersey-recent-sales-986693.html","abstract":"  Clinton  $160,000   12 Marudy Drive  3-bedroom, 1-bath, 29-year-old ranch, den, h/w floors, ceiling fans; taxes $2,560.

Sixty-one extraordinary faces -- most belonging to well-known writers, artists and performers -- are on view in the elegant volume THE PASSIONATE OBSERVER: Photographs by Carl Van Vechten (Hallmark Cards/University of New Mexico, cloth, $40; paper, $25). Carl Van Vechten (1880-1964) was a connoisseur of avant-garde art, dance and music, an early and knowledgeable enthusiast of black American culture, and a writer whose work included music criticism for The New York Times early in the century, seven novels, and eight volumes of music and literary criticism. Gregarious and a bit of a dandy (he was known for gold and jade bracelets and outrageous neckties), Van Vechten counted among his friends Gertrude Stein, George Gershwin, Paul Robeson, W. Somerset Maugham, Langston Hughes, Eugene O'Neill and Mabel Dodge. He was an inveterate collector and cataloguer; at the age of 15 he began taking photographs with a box camera. Of the more than 15,000 photographs he made over the last 30 years of his life, most are portraits, many of friends or acquaintances. \"His artistic vision was founded on a belief in the primacy of the talented individual and a recognition of the varied backgrounds, temperaments and tastes from which such accomplishment could arise,\" Keith F. Davis, the fine-arts programs director at Hallmark Cards, writes in a graceful and informative essay. Van Vechten's photographs combine the informality and immediacy of the snapshot with a highly personal and studied documentation of his subjects. In portraits of subjects like Gershwin, Maugham, Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, Bessie Smith, Willa Cather, Anna May Wong, Marlon Brando and Thomas Mann, Van Vechten created strange, evocative images that reveal aspects not only of the subject but also of the photographer and of his era.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"School Budgets: Books or Boilers?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/nyregion/school-budgets-books-or-boilers.html","abstract":"MILDRED J.

At the midpoint the leaders were: in first place, Bill Eisenberg of Boca Raton, Fla., and Martin Scheinberg of Manhattan, plus 953 imps; in second, Ron Gerard of White Plains and Mike Kamil of Teaneck, N.J., plus 933; in third, Fred Stewart of Accord, N.Y., and Steve Weinstein of Upper Montclair, N.J., plus 840.   In the most interesting deal of the first day's play, Gerard as South landed in five clubs doubled on the diagramed deal. He ruffed the opening heart lead, cashed the club ace and gave up a club to West. Another heart lead was ruffed, and he finessed the spade queen successfully. Dummy's last heart was ruffed and three more trump leads left this ending: [ Diagram ] .   When the last trump was led, West was forced to part with the diamond three.

Each work seemed to be propelled by a set of inner conflicts, by competing impulses pulling against each other.    In the case of Donald Martino's Set for Clarinet (1954), those impulses were the desire to draw on popular forms -- jazz and blues -- but to do so within a language of rigorous atonality, and to shine a spotlight on a clarinetist's virtuosity without losing sight of the work's compositional ingenuity. The thematic and harmonic simplicity of John Cage's Six Melodies for Violin and Piano (1950) disguises subtle complexities and elaboration. Elizabeth Brown's \"Memory Palace\" (1990), for flute, cello and piano, uses a tonally freewheeling language (neither strictly rooted nor fully atonal) and an abstract structure to paint a distinct, if fanciful, picture in which thematic relationships come increasingly into focus as the piece unfolds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930510","headline":"Marshak Memorial Service","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/10/us/marshak-memorial-service.html","abstract":"  City College will hold a memorial service for President Emeritus Robert Eugene Marshak at 3 P.M.

Sampras is playing in his second tournament on clay this season and his first on the slower, red surface in Europe. He was generally satisfied with his game in the 1-hour-39-minute match, especially for having staved off a third set on a hot, sunny day at the Foro Italico. Sampras saved a set point when the 50th-ranked Furlan returned a deep service into the net, and the American later ended the match with an ace in the tie breaker. Fourth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, who is also more accustomed to faster surfaces, defeated Jaime Oncins, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, and then called the victory his best match of his injury-plagued season. Jan Siemerink beat No. 12-seeded MaliVai Washington, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), to score the first upset in the $1.75 million tournament. Scheduled to play their opening matches today are second-seeded Jim Courier, the defending champion at the Italian Open, and third-seeded Boris Becker, who has won only two matches in four clay-court tournaments this spring. Meanwhile, the ATP Tour announced it was conducting anti-doping tests during the Italian Open, the first time since implementing stricter penalties in March.

Clinton Administration officials confirmed today that he had been nominated to succeed William H. Draper 3d, who said last week that he would step down on July 15. Mr. Draper has been administrator since 1986, and his second four-year term was scheduled to end next year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930511","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/11/nyregion/c-corrections-595693.html","abstract":"  A picture caption on Saturday about a memorial service for the violinist Nathan Milstein misidentified the woman at the center.

One fine thing about those commercial messages, the satellite's developers say -- apart from the pleasure they'll bring those who'd rather look at a detergent ad than the Pleiades -- is that they'll pay for the craft's scientific mission of studying the earth's atmosphere.

The individual fibers in yarns are made of long polymer chains, or strands of giant molecules, according to Dr. Lemley, who is a chemist. In their natural state, the chains are scrolled up or crinkled. In preparing them for spinning and weaving, the first step is usually a straightening of the fibers by processes like carding wool.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930511","headline":"Ex-Employee Is Convicted","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/11/nyregion/ex-employee-is-convicted.html","abstract":"  A former employee of a Gap clothing store was convicted yesterday of murdering the store's assistant manager during a robbery.
