But never have I felt more successful at this often difficult task than one evening at an Italian restaurant in Princeton called Casabona. Everyone at the table was served his entree but me. Not only had the waiter forgotten to order my liver with balsamic vinegar, but when he went to the kitchen to do so, there was none left.\n\nThat particular evening there were quite a few items at this Mercer County restaurant that were either not available or where substitutions were made, frequently to the detriment of the dish. Salmon with mustard sauce sounded delicious, but baby bass was substituted and the mustard overpowered this more delicate fish. More unusual was to find a restaurant all out of buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and sun-dried tomatoes at 8 P.M.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940925","headline":"In Quest for Perot Constituents, Cuomo Attacks, Pataki Parries","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/25/nyregion/in-quest-for-perot-constituents-cuomo-attacks-pataki-parries.html","abstract":"  Behind in the polls and facing a crowd of angry, independent voters, Gov.

Whichever side turns out to be right, the ramifications pose even greater problems for major league baseball than the 45-day-old strike has already inflicted.   Talk of spring training, or the fate of it, or what will happen during it, is premature. A significant amount of time remains before teams even have to plan for it. But the talk has begun because neither side feels optimistic about the ability to reach an agreement before spring training.

The note begins to break up but hangs around in its own staticky penumbra, crackling and frazzling through the first verse as Michael Stipe sings, \"Here comes that awful feeling again.\" And it reappears throughout the song, holding on after the band is done. Its sculptured cantankerousness might as well continue through the whole album; R.E.M. has started to blare again, brilliantly.    The sound of \"Monster\" (Warner Brothers 45740; LP, cassette and CD) won't surprise longtime fans. Since 1981, R.E.M. has cut a path for what came to be called alternative rock. The band came out of a small college town (Athens, Ga.) with the do-it-yourself mentality of punk rock and a revived folk-rock lexicon; its songs were urgent, mysterious and memorable.

Who needs real history when we can get Disney's cleaned-up version? \n\nHere is my idea. The Disney Company should be invited to build their historical theme park here. But we have to do a bit of creative thinking, because Long Island history is dull. The early Dutch settlers were unexciting to the point of paralysis, and the English settlers who came after were . . . well . . . English. We don't have any Civil War battlefields and in the Revolutionary War there was just one battle -- the inglorious Battle of Long Island, on Aug. 28, 1776. It lasted one day, and ended with Washington's sneaking his troops across the East River in rowboats, abandoning the Island to the British.

Attaining sufficient international stature to be invited to open a season at Carnegie Hall -- as the academy will do on Thursday evening -- was surely not in the prospectus.   But an Australian heiress who owned a record company heard those first concerts and recorded the group in Baroque works. With critics praising the clarity of the performances, and Baroque music poised to become a growth industry, the recordings instantly became popular and led to concert dates, which led to more recordings; the academy's 1984 soundtrack to \"Amadeus\" has sold more than two million copies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940925","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/25/books/in-short-nonfiction-328332.html","abstract":"   FREE SPEECH  STIFLED LAUGHTER  One Woman's Story  About Fighting Censorship.

Never one to miss an election-year trick, Governor Cuomo chimed in with his own tax-cut package. He too put off telling voters whose programs will be gored.   The candidates are right that New York taxes are sky high. Last week's report by the State Business Council confirms what many other studies also show: state and local taxes, measured as a percentage of personal income, are 40 percent higher in New York than the national average. Only Alaska is higher and Hawaii close behind. But oil companies pay over 85 percent of Alaska's taxes; tourists pay a large share of Hawaii's.

What is fiction, to borrow a phrase, is the idea that we have in any way dealt irresponsibly with the history that is the basis for this film.    The weightiest charge Mr. Bernstein can make is that the film condenses a series of investigators into one figure -- in fact, the one prosecutor who was at all successful in his pursuit -- Richard Goodwin.

The tour, which includes much of the piano nobile, or first floor, starts from the vast courtyard by Domenico Fontana, and moves through the rooms frescoed in the early 17th century for Pope Paul V Borghese, then the gallery decorated for Pope Alexander VII under the direction of the great Baroque master Pietro da Cortona. The tour of the piano nobile also visits the Sala del Diluvio with its decorations by the Carracci family, the Scalone d'Onore with its imposing fresco of \"Christ in Glory Among the Angels,\" by Melozzo da Forli, the Cappella Paolina, a chapel the same size as the Sistine chapel, and the chapel of the Annunciation, which has frescoes by Guido Reni. Furniture from four centuries, Roman mosaics, ceramic vases, bronzes and paintings are scattered throughout.    The Quirinale palace, built on the highest of the seven hills of ancient Rome, was begun in 1573 by Gregory XIII to serve as the summer residence for the popes. Over the years the palace grew both in size and in the wealth of its collection. It was finished under Clement XII (1730-40), but as early as 1587 Sixtus V began living there during the hot Roman summer months.  The palace remained a summer residence of the popes until 1870; it then became the home of the Savoy kings, a role it served until 1946, when the republican constitution designated the President of the Republic its new resident.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940925","headline":"BACKTALK;\nLet's Put Reason Back in Baseball Debate","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/25/sports/backtalk-lets-put-reason-back-in-baseball-debate.html","abstract":"Some calm reflection is needed about the baseball situation.

While doing archival research in Berlin in 1991, Mr. Attie, a San Francisco artist, found himself wondering what became of the Jewish community there. He projected slides of prewar German Jewish life onto housefronts standing today, using the original sites whenever possible: images of a Talmud school, Hebrew bookstore, kosher butcher, Jewish theater, Torah reading room, along with a religious book salesman and other Jewish residents, are juxtaposed with a mundane, modern railroad station, buildings, highways, cars and billboards. In an essay accompanying THE WRITING ON THE WALL: Projections in Berlin's Jewish Quarter (Edition Braus/Phillip Galgiani, P.O. Box 457, Prince Street Station, New York, N.Y., 10012, $30), Michael Andre Bernstein, a professor of English literature at the University of California, Berkeley, eloquently discusses Mr. Attie's photographic techniques and the emotional textures they render. Erwin Leiser, a German writer and film maker living in Zurich, provides a moving colloquial history of anti-Semitism in Berlin before and during World War II, when synagogues were set ablaze, Jewish-owned businesses were looted and tens of thousands of Jews were transported to concentration camps. Yet Mr. Attie's 30 reproductions need no explanation. Every page seems to prove that evil can't be erased, that stores, windows and lampposts bear their own witness and that Jewish ghosts remain forever ensconced in the streets where they were betrayed.

He started his set with a display of bravado, volatility and tenderness, singing without words against a hovering guitar chord.

Through an inspired 20-year collaboration with the pianist and arranger Wally Harper, she has evolved into a cabaret singer of increasing range and depth who spices up a traditional sweetness with her own version of a mature red-hot mama. Although the collaboration has had its stagnant moments, it has just now reached a new peak of creativity and intelligence.   Ms. Cook's new show, which opened a four-week engagement at the Cafe Carlyle on Tuesday evening, finds her exploring her playfully bluesy side with renewed enthusiasm. Without giving up the wistful ballads that remain the cornerstone of her act, the singer has developed a middle and lower vocal range that brings out her sense of humor and shows off her growing rhythmic adventurousness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940926","headline":"Image Makers Hard at Work In the Selling of a Candidate","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/26/us/1994-campaign-image-image-makers-hard-work-selling-candidate.html","abstract":"  Nearly 200 miles from the campaign's headquarters in Harrisburg, Pa., but just next door to the recording studio of the pop singer Cyndi Lauper in midtown Manhattan, media consultants gathered to shape the image of Tom Ridge, the Republican candidate for governor of Pennsylvania.

Their tipped, 64-yard game-winning pass, the one that gave Colorado its 27-26 victory over Michigan and lifted the Buffaloes into the fifth spot in the national polls, returned to the places where such unthinkable successes are first conceived. Back to the grass of backyards or the asphalt of neighborhood streets just as the autumn sky is darkening, as it was over Michigan Stadium early Saturday evening, and meals are being placed on the table.   \"Dinner's ready.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940926","headline":"Karen Akers's Classically Controlled Pop","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/26/arts/cabaret-review-karen-akers-s-classically-controlled-pop.html","abstract":"  In her meticulous presentation of songs and cool, statuesque demeanor, Karen Akers comes closer than any American cabaret performer to treating pop as a close relative of European art song. Ms. Akers, who opened a four-week engagement at Rainbow and Stars (30 Rockefeller Plaza) on Tuesday evening, exudes the emotional control of someone who measures by the teaspoon how much to let go and how much to hold back in performances that have the atmosphere of recitals.    More than once in Tuesday's opening-night performance, Ms. Akers described what she does as \"showing songs.\" And the accompaniments by a drumless trio that featured reed instruments contributed to the evening's semi-classical aura.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940926","headline":"Making Awkwardness an Advantage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/26/arts/pop-review-making-awkwardness-an-advantage.html","abstract":"  Not every musician is a natural-born performer. Even after years of steady touring, some bands are still awkward on stage. That vulnerability and lack of pretension is part of the appeal of alternative rock, and on Friday night at the Manhattan Center, shyness was the operative word as Grant Lee Buffalo, American Music Club and St. Etienne performed a CMJ Music Marathon as part of a Warner Brothers Records showcase.   It would be nice to see Grant Lee Buffalo, a trio from Los Angeles, sell as many records as other popular new bands like Collective Soul and Candlebox. Grant Lee Buffalo not only writes catchy alternative-rock songs with classic-rock melodies, butalso plays smart, original music with genuine emotion and no compromises.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940926","headline":"Clinton Seeks to Delay Bosnian Arms Pledge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/26/world/clinton-seeks-to-delay-bosnian-arms-pledge.html","abstract":"  As he prepared to address the United Nations and got ready for a two-day meeting with President Boris N.
