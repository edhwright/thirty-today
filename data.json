There are gloriously bizarre surprises hidden in the English phase of Alfred Hitchcock's career, those early days when he was scarcely a gleam in Hollywood's eye. Among the oddities from the 1930's are: a killer who turns out to be a cross-dressing trapeze artist; a wry comedy about marriage in which no one comes close to being murdered, and more toy trains than you've seen since childhood. And though Hitchcock went to Hollywood for good in 1939, he returned to England near the end of World War II to make the strangest movies of his career: two French-language propaganda films of such cynicism and double-agentry that they might end war altogether. After watching these shorts, no one could possibly figure out who was fighting whom, much less whom to trust.    \" 'Cocky' in Britain: The Early Alfred Hitchcock\" is the too-too-clever title of the delicious series that begins today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. \"Cocky\" refers to the director's boyhood nickname as well as his thumb-your-nose attitude, but while the title's peculiar British ring is jarring, it does make sense. The series follows Hitchcock as he moves away from his Cockney background toward Hollywood, a process that transformed him from Cocky to Hitch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930507","headline":"Review/City Ballet; Counting Down: 73 Works","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/arts/review-city-ballet-counting-down-73-works.html","abstract":"  The New York City Ballet began its survey of 73 ballets by George Balanchine in earnest on Wednesday night.

It is the subject of a show well worth seeing called \"Czech Cubism: Architecture and Design, 1910-1925,\" at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.   Does it sound provincial? It is, but in giving Cubism a Bohemian slant, Czech architects and designers were actually developing an appealing provincialism. They seem to have taken from France only the surface of what Picasso and Braque had invented: a vocabulary of folded, angular forms that made the Czechs' designs for buildings and furniture look weird and agitated without being fully Cubist in their reorganization of space. At the same time, their forms bring to mind the pointy Gothic spires and the steeply gabled roofs from Prague's history.

The current status symbols are gas grills that cost half as much as a car, flavored wood chips, exotic marinades and fancy salsas. And as Americans look for food that is low in fat and calories, without preservatives, sugar or rich creamy sauces, so the search for new flavors and ingredients continues.   As noted last week, Oriental seasonings -- soy sauce, sesame oil, fresh coriander -- do a great job of enhancing the taste of grilled foods, especially seafood. I like to buy shrimp in Chinatown, where they are sold with their heads on, and soak them for a couple of hours in heavily salted ice water, which leaches out impurities. They are then patted dry and tossed in a mixture of peanut oil and black and red peppers with garlic.

Earlier in the evening, the faculty had given a concert for the back-porch musicians who'd come to Elkins, W.Va., to immerse themselves in music lessons and impromptu jam sessions.  Now, in the Ice House, the funky beer hall that is the center of nocturnal activity on the campus of Davis and Elkins College, Gaye Adegbalola was leading a rowdy choir through a tune called \"Meet Me With Your Black Drawers On.\" With a point of her finger, Ms. Adegbalola, a vocal instructor who spends the rest of her year performing with the group Saffire, would direct an individual to improvise a verse to the bawdy blues. The boisterous assembly did not have to be encouraged to join in on the chorus.    Outside, on the porch of Halliehurst, a palatial mansion that recently celebrated its centennial, members of Group du Jour, a zydeco band from Minneapolis, formed the core of a late-night jam session that mixed country blues with rollicking Cajun music. A few dozen observers, some of them dancing on Halliehurst's wide wooden porch, enjoyed moments of music that were deserving of a big-city cover charge and a two-drink minimum. Yet played under stars spread across a mountain sky, the music seemed enriched by the fact that it was created not for fame, but for fun.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"Sue Thornton, Adrian Chanler","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/style/weddings-sue-thornton-adrian-chanler.html","abstract":"  Sue Hay Thornton, a lawyer in Charleston, S.C., was married yesterday to Adrian J.

And what have we received of late? The season ended last weekend with the twilight of Wagner's gods; some people talk about the Met as though it deserved a similar send-off. For all the triumph of the Wagner \"Ring\" performances, overall attendance dropped this season (to 89 percent of capacity, from 92 percent last season), and there was many a mundane evening (including the first performances of Rossini's \"Semiramide\" and Verdi's \"Ballo in Maschera\"). It would be easy to compile a damning list of callow tenors, worn sopranos, uneven casts, dull conductors, misjudged theatrics, neglected opportunities.   But the Met's track record this season was actually one that any company in the world might envy. It included the revival of a 1964 production of Verdi's \"Falstaff\" in a sterling performance that almost made it seem as if Paul Plishka, Marilyn Horne and Mirella Freni were part of a polished repertory company -- alert to one another and to the score. Otto Schenk's new production of Wagner's \"Meistersinger\" was suffused with good sense and exceptional ensemble work; its Nuremburg included Hermann Prey, Donald McIntyre and Karita Mattila. To my ears, \"Die Walkure\" was the musical standard-bearer for the Met \"Ring,\" and the Met orchestra played it nearly seamlessly.

Not only are there a multitude of variables to consider (type of transmission, mileage allowance, insurance coverage, taxes, car size and currency exchange), but there are also such questions as whether to make a reservation, whether to prepay, whether to pay a surcharge for the convenience of picking up the car at the airport and whether to choose longer-term leasing over short-term renting.   Even a survey of only three major rental companies with headquarters in the United States -- Avis, Hertz and National -- opens a can of worms. The companies were asked to supply details on the countries where a visitor to western Europe would be most likely to find the least-expensive economy cars for one week in the summer season and, for comparison, the cost of upgrading to the least-expensive car with automatic transmission. Only two of the three companies gave a breakdown of basic rates and rates with the collision-damage waiver (C.D.W.). Avis offered rates as an inclusive package with unlimited mileage, waiver and tax, or as an exclusive package with unlimited mileage only. All three offered unlimited mileage with a weekly rental; not all do for a one-day rental.  The C.D.W. Factor     As most people who have rented cars in the United States know, one complicating factor is the collision- damage waiver (C.D.W.), which is not actually true insurance. The car-rental companies are not selling a policy; they are collecting an extra fee for offering to forgive the cost of any damage. Like the basic car rental rates, the C.D.W. fee can be as much or as little as the traffic will bear.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"For Achievers, Young and Not So","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/style/evening-hours-for-achievers-young-and-not-so.html","abstract":"  Benefits honor leaders in the arts, fashion and social work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"2d Founder Died in Duel","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/opinion/l-2d-founder-died-in-duel-393193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In the \"Memorial to Alexander Hamilton\" (April 24) there is an error.

Sixty-one extraordinary faces -- most belonging to well-known writers, artists and performers -- are on view in the elegant volume THE PASSIONATE OBSERVER: Photographs by Carl Van Vechten (Hallmark Cards/University of New Mexico, cloth, $40; paper, $25). Carl Van Vechten (1880-1964) was a connoisseur of avant-garde art, dance and music, an early and knowledgeable enthusiast of black American culture, and a writer whose work included music criticism for The New York Times early in the century, seven novels, and eight volumes of music and literary criticism. Gregarious and a bit of a dandy (he was known for gold and jade bracelets and outrageous neckties), Van Vechten counted among his friends Gertrude Stein, George Gershwin, Paul Robeson, W. Somerset Maugham, Langston Hughes, Eugene O'Neill and Mabel Dodge. He was an inveterate collector and cataloguer; at the age of 15 he began taking photographs with a box camera. Of the more than 15,000 photographs he made over the last 30 years of his life, most are portraits, many of friends or acquaintances. \"His artistic vision was founded on a belief in the primacy of the talented individual and a recognition of the varied backgrounds, temperaments and tastes from which such accomplishment could arise,\" Keith F. Davis, the fine-arts programs director at Hallmark Cards, writes in a graceful and informative essay. Van Vechten's photographs combine the informality and immediacy of the snapshot with a highly personal and studied documentation of his subjects. In portraits of subjects like Gershwin, Maugham, Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, Bessie Smith, Willa Cather, Anna May Wong, Marlon Brando and Thomas Mann, Van Vechten created strange, evocative images that reveal aspects not only of the subject but also of the photographer and of his era.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"School Budgets: Books or Boilers?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/nyregion/school-budgets-books-or-boilers.html","abstract":"MILDRED J.

The term refers to the chemicals in the binders, which make up the film that forms when the paint dries. The best latex-based paint contains 100 percent acrylic binders, which adhere more strongly than other types and also bond to a wider range of surfaces.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"The Importance Of Being Mom: Three Stories","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/nyregion/the-importance-of-being-mom-three-stories.html","abstract":"NICHOLAUS, who is 4 years old, wants to make creepy crawlers and he pulls lightly on his mother's leg every couple of minutes. \"Maybe us can make creepy crawlers?\" Peggy Coyle smiles at her son and says, \"Very soon.\"\n\nKatrina, 3, wants to know when she'll be having her bedtime bath. \" 'Cuse me.

Richard Manoogian, however, reversed the procedure when, in the 1970's, he began with works by Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Frank Stella and their like. After that he turned his attention to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, acquiring works of artists from Martin Johnson Heade to William Merritt Chase, and from the trompe l'oeil specialists, John Peto and William Harnett, to the portraitist, John Singer Sargent, and assorted American Impressionists.   It is the kind of art making up the Yale University Art Gallery show, \"A Private View: American Painting From the Manoogian Collection.\" Evidently the collector has sustained a change of heart as well as of taste, for the show is very much a celebration of the good life as it was led in the Victorian and Edwardian eras.
