For anyone who has flown in China, the new safety drive is much overdue. China's economic takeoff has produced a boom in air travel -- and accidents -- with the increase in new domestic airlines last year allowed by the breakup of the state air monopoly in 1988.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930916","headline":"Longtime Friends With Stars In the Eyes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/16/sports/pro-football-longtime-friends-with-stars-in-the-eyes.html","abstract":"  At the University of Pittsburgh, Sean Gilbert and Keith Hamilton were good friends and teammates. The defensive linemen have tried to stay in touch since leaving college, but both are busy men. However, Gilbert, with the Los Angeles Rams, and Hamilton, with the Giants, will definitely see each other when they walk onto the field on Sunday at Giants Stadium. They have both reached the top -- and they have to be amazed at the different way they got there.   Hamilton was supposed to be the blue-chip draft pick. Going into his final year at Pitt in 1991, he was considered one of the top pass rushers in college, but something happened on the way to becoming a first-rounder. He was tagged as a problem child, a big-time talent minus the work ethic. None of these labels were ever really confirmed, but the whispers resulted in Hamilton's slipping to the fourth round of the 1992 draft, where the Giants snapped him up.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930916","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/16/nyregion/c-corrections-899093.html","abstract":"  A picture yesterday with an obituary of Iva Sergei Voidato Patcevitch, a retired chairman of Conde Nast Publications, was published in error.

They were not wasting their time. Mr. Mamikonian, a 23-year-old Armenian pianist who has studied with Jorg Demus and Lazar Berman -- polar opposites, one would think -- demonstrated a technique that combines power and gracefulness, an ear for stylistic nuance and flashes of interpretive ingenuity.

Incredibly well executed, the show combined the best of hip-hop with riveting if abbreviated jazz riffs. Guru, who is half the hard-core hip-hop duo Gang Starr, is known for his monotonal and blase delivery and thoughtful if raw lyrics. The show, like his own album, \"Jazzmatazz Vol. 1,\" is Guru's attempt at fusing jazz and hip-hop. The two genres, often compared because of their similar origins, existed symbiotically onstage. Each was clearly if only slightly changed by the other.  It was an easy fusion, almost as if the fuss over it is unwarranted.\n\nBy the time the band went into \"Transit Ride,\" a lyrical tour of New York's subways, the band had melded. Guru was on point with one of his best songs and the horn section, highlighted by the sweet-sounding hollowness of Donald Byrd's trumpet, was blowing in rich unison. The guitarist Zachary Breaux was making his funky presence known, and the disk jockey, Jazzy Nice, contributed the occasional well-timed scratch from the turntables.

Maybe a little too perfectly. Anyone coming to this show expecting to find the emotional gravity of the 17th-century Baroque golden age will be disappointed. The silver age that followed, at least as represented in these watercolors, asked something different of its artists: polish rather than depth, and a secular, rational light in place of the spiritual dramas of chiaroscuro. Drama itself, in fact, seems to have gone out of fashion. Clouds pile up in the skies, the star-crossed lovers of classical myth appear, but there is little sign of storms or hearts breaking. The only real narratives are illustrated scenes from popular stage farces, and the emblems of transience that ran like a subtle bass note throughout Dutch painting of an earlier day find little place.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930917","headline":"Mexico Takes Giant Steps Toward a New Era","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/17/opinion/l-mexico-takes-giant-steps-toward-a-new-era-214393.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Whatever one's view of the North American Free Trade Agreement, your pages have largely overlooked Mexico's moves toward fundamental political change since the country's 1988 electoral trauma.

Looking at the images she has made over the last 28 years, 66 of which form a spare and illuminating exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, it also seems likely that Ms. Celmins helped set the stage for the highly artificialized realism that permeated the art of the 1980's.

Despite such possible connections and credits, Ms. Celmins has always been oddly on her own, an artist's artist who has quietly pursued her almost obsessive vision without benefit of stardom. In career and sensibility she seems closest to a late-blooming abstract painter like Agnes Martin or, even more, the reclusive 50's artist Myron Stout, with whom she shares a penchant for technical perfection, graphite and small images, as well as a low, sporadic output.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930917","headline":"Recount Scheduled in White Plains Mayoral Primary","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/17/nyregion/recount-scheduled-in-white-plains-mayoral-primary.html","abstract":"  Mayor Alfred Del Vecchio got the surprise of his political life this week when unofficial results of a primary race too close to call showed his challenger for the Republican nomination, Michael A.

Politicians have spoken so loudly and so often on the free-trade agreement that the economists seem to have been pushed into the background.

Nigel Hawthorne, who plays the monarch who lost America in \"The Madness of George III,\" makes it easy. His astonishing performance, a cascading flow of endearing bluster, hot rage and scalding tears, begins where his dry comedic turn in television's \"Yes, Minister\" leaves off; it makes his Tony Award-winning portrait of C. S. Lewis in \"Shadowlands\" look like a cameo. Who could not love a ruler who merges the accessible, everyman's nobility of Ralph Richardson with the plebeian, jocular vulgarity of Mel Brooks?   The play that provides the springboard for Mr. Hawthorne's triumph is by Alan Bennett, who is arguably the best playwright in England whose major works remain unproduced in the American theater. \"The Madness of George III\" is not one of those major works, but it would be silly to complain too much about a play that gives audiences a chance to savor an unforgettable performance. And it's easy to see why \"George III,\" in its original Royal National Theater production directed by Nicholas Hytner, has been sent on American tour while tougher Bennett works like \"Single Spies\" and \"Talking Heads\" have been limited to piecemeal presentation on public television. With its 18th-century pomp and circumstance, large cast, flourishes of Handel and opulent rustle of costumes, \"George III\" is more readily marketable as the sort of Broadway entertainment the Colonies are thought to prefer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930917","headline":"Smith (1-0), Cowboys (0-2) Come to Terms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/17/sports/pro-football-smith-1-0-cowboys-0-2-come-to-terms.html","abstract":"  It took a while for Jerry Jones to see the handwriting on the scoreboard, and even then he had to swallow twice.

Hun Sen, who leads the main opposition party, is to be the \"Second President.\" 3  CLINTON DEFENDS U.S. IN SOMALIA    Defending American action in Somalia, President Clinton said the United States was willing to increase its military role there to help insure the viability of a new government.  5  OPTIMISM FOR PEACE IN SARAJEVO    Mediators preparing for talks in Sarajevo speak as if an end to the war in Bosnia is in sight, but the major roadblocks to an accord remain.  4  ECONOMIC TETHERS TO ISRAEL    Despite visions of new prosperity, the reality of Palestinian self-rule in the territories is likely to be an economy that remains tied to Israel's.  5  WEST PLEASED AT GAIDAR'S RETURN    The return of Yegor T.

Even the slightest mention of a Slovak blemish in the local or foreign press inevitably provokes finger-wagging lectures from Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and his deputies on the \"responsibility\" of the press or, when that seems too mild, accusations that a wicked press is out to crush the infant republic.    The problem is not, of course, unique to Slovakia. A combination of governmental ham-handedness and near-zero understanding of an independent press has choked off free discussion in many former Communist states, including many of the recent breakaways from the former Soviet Union.

Where many rockers turn introspective as they move toward middle age, Mr. Hiatt has decided to howl louder.   Although he is one of the best word-slingers among American songwriters -- \"You're under my skin like a submarine\" -- Mr. Hiatt delights in the wordless pleasures of rock: the impact of a power chord or a tom-tom socked on an offbeat; a vocal that turns into growls or falsetto whoops. His voice is a baritone with a trapdoor into the bass range; he can invoke the nasal tension of country singing and the full-throated release of soul shouting. Onstage, he mugs through his songs, rubber-faced and intent on every detail, putting thumb and forefinger together in a line about smoke rings, holding up both arms to gesture like a preacher, rolling his eyes and jerking his chin in happy reaction to one of Michael Ward's squealing guitar solos.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930918","headline":"Sarajevo Meeting on Peace Pact Is Set; U.S. May Ease Sanctions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/18/world/sarajevo-meeting-on-peace-pact-is-set-us-may-ease-sanctions.html","abstract":"  Secretary of State Warren Christopher has sent a message to the Belgrade Government hinting at the possibility of easing economic and political sanctions against Serbia in the event of a Bosnian peace settlement.

Two local school boards have voted to close their schools on Monday in defiance of orders from the Board of Education and the new Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines. Another, on Staten Island, grudgingly agreed yesterday to open its schools after Mr. Cortines offered his help in getting results of asbestos tests in their schools.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930918","headline":"For Savers, It's Tough At the Top","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/18/your-money/IHT-for-savers-its-tough-at-the-top.html","abstract":"SO it seems like the predicted corrections are occurring sooner rather than later.

Failed promises to reform Japan's corruption-ridden electoral process have ended the terms of the last two Prime Ministers, both from the Liberal Democratic Party. The party was driven from office in July for the first time in 37 years, and Mr. Hosokawa has promised to overhaul a system that has encouraged companies and gangsters to buy off leading politicians.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930918","headline":"Make Cable TV Gang Truly Competitive; Illusory Alternative","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/18/opinion/l-make-cable-tv-gang-truly-competitive-illusory-alternative-517293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"You're the Viewer.

Moreover, the technology does not of itself allow for delivery of any video to anyone, as the author maintains.

From the late 1960's to the mid-1970's, Canterbury spawned a handful of overlapping bands that quietly invented a local version of progressive rock. Richard Sinclair, who played bass and sang for four leading Canterbury bands -- Wildeflowers, Caravan, Camel, and Hatfield and the North -- showed that the style survives when he slipped into New York on Wednesday night for a solo show at Fez, at Lafayette and Great Jones Streets. The early set was broadcast live by WFMU.    The Canterbury style was genial and free-flowing, tinged with folksy melody and jazz harmonies and always underplaying its musical gamesmanship; it channeled free-form psychedelic jamming into elastic song structures. The music ambled along with asymmetrical tunes that interrupted themselves or sped up to cram more words in or wandered off on tangents. The lyrics, too, meandered from declarations of love to everyday worries to philosophical shrugs: \"The only thing to do is grin and bear it.\" Mr. Sinclair's voice, a sleepy, breathy croon, was the perfect medium for such kindly tidings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930918","time":"1993-09-18
