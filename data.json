J. Simpson remains in custody, charged with murdering his former wife and one of her friends. His defense remains the same: He did not do it. The authorities in Los Angeles remain in sole possession of the evidence, so it is difficult to assess his veracity. But despite all the uncertainties, lawyers following the case generally agree on several suppositions about how the Simpson case may develop.   Most important, they said that because Mr. Simpson seemed to remain a beloved figure to many people, despite standing accused of two brutal murders, despite fleeing from the authorities, a jury could well treat him more leniently than it would the average criminal defendant. - A jury, these lawyers said, could well grasp at potential defense arguments that Mr. Simpson was mentally unstable or in a jealous rage, not just to spare Mr. Simpson's life but to convict him of a lesser charge, like manslaughter, or even to find him not guilty by reason of insanity. For anyone who could be cheered as if charging toward the end zone as the police pursued him across the freeways of Los Angeles on Friday, popularity may be the ultimate defense.   These lawyers say that notwithstanding Mr. Simpson's status as an icon, they expect the Los Angeles District Attorney, already burdened by a series of embarrassing losses in other highly publicized cases and charges of preferential treatment here, to seek the death penalty in the case. But they are just as sure Mr. Simpson, a football star and hero to millions, remains too beloved for any jury to send to the gas chamber.

No more. The last six months show how superficial that stability was. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has been jolted by an armed peasant revolt, still unresolved, the assassination of its presidential candidate, still unexplained, and seismic internal rifts, still producing aftershocks.    But with Mexico's least predictable presidential election of modern times just two months away, Mexicans have a chance to move toward real democracy. Some polls now show Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the opposition National Action Party running almost even with the PRI candidate, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.

Originally recorded in 1975, this album is a paradigm for experimental Afro-Hispanic music that's being carried on to this day. The performers, Grupo Folklorico y Experimental Nuevayorquino, included Andy and Jerry Gonzalez, the great trumpeter Chocolate Armenteros, Milton Cardona and many others; they successfully surveyed both older, more folkloric styles of Cuban and Puerto Rican music (innovative in itself), but also brought it all up to date. It's also an album that could only be made in New York, where all this music could be mulled over and reconstructed without the chauvinism that often plagues regional music. And it jumps out with its power. The album gives up a lot of space to improvisation, and it rocks with riffs. Unfortunately, there are virtually no liner notes, and the original two-volume classic album, when transferred to CD, is now missing two tracks. But what's there is exquisite, capturing a moment where experimentation seemed fresh, a justified response to both commercialism and classicism.

Such questions, chewed over since the 1970's when the Loud family's real-life soap opera drew big audiences to public stations, present themselves again tonight on \"The Trouble With Evan.\"   Evan is an 11-year-old boy in Hamilton, Ontario, given to picking on other children, smoking, setting fires, shoplifting and in general being a big headache to his mother, Karin, and stepfather, Mike. They permitted a producer from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to install motion-activated cameras in their kitchen and recreation room, so tonight you can see the pair berating, accusing (sometimes unjustly), insulting, bullying, threatening and generally tormenting Evan, who sits quietly in his corner taking it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940621","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/21/nyregion/news-summary-452980.html","abstract":"  International A3-9  AFRICA'S RISKY POLITICAL CHANGE  Many African countries are moving toward democracy, but the move toward reform is uneven and leaves uncertainties about what lies ahead, especially as it reveals longstanding ethnic tensions.

Squeezed to 20 times the density of lead and heated to a searing 200 million degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than the surface of the sun, the atoms in the pellet would fuse together, releasing a miniature thermonuclear blast of fusion energy.    Such a device could materialize by the year 2002 if the dream machine gets approval from the Department of Energy. It would cost $1 billion to build and about $250 million a year to operate -- no small sum over a 30-year lifetime -- and Congress may well balk at its cost.

The bill would prohibit smoking in schools and on school grounds, and ban the sale of out-of-package or \"loosie\" cigarettes. It would also require separate, enclosed smoking rooms in workplace lounges and cafeterias, and would limit hospital smoking to patients who obtained written authorization from physicians. Smoking in transportation terminals, buses and restrooms would be banned too, as well as in youth centers, child care facilities, group homes for children, public institutions for children and residential treatment facilities.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940622","headline":"Kemp Agrees to Pay Campaign Penalties","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/22/us/kemp-agrees-to-pay-campaign-penalties.html","abstract":"  Jack F.

For one thing, the lag between a politician's moment in history and the subsequent book is often ample for the public to forget the person or lose interest. For another, publishers are so susceptible to famous people -- even if the people are famous simply because they did some relatively minor thing during some administration or other -- that they often pay too high an advance, print too many copies and end up with too many unsold books. \"It is indeed a tough judgment call, and we've all made mistakes,\" said Caroline K. Reidy, president and publisher of Simon & Schuster's adult trade division.    But this month, publishers who bet lots of money on books by politicians have good reason to be pleased with themselves. In a curious confluence of events, three political books are enjoying long runs on the nonfiction best-seller lists. These are \"Standing Firm\" (HarperCollins/Zondervan), by Dan Quayle; \"Beyond Peace\" (Random House), by Richard Nixon, and \"The Haldeman Diaries\" (Putnam), by H. R. Haldeman. \"All these books are selling much better than we expected,\" said Susie Russenberger, director of trade books at Ingram, a book wholesaler.

The Yankees represent social and political values that ought to be protected if reasonable compromise can be reached, including public expenditures. The amount must be related to value, especially when schools, police and infrastructure are under attack.

As their anger mounts, their heart rates drop and their attention sharpens, making their violence an act of calculated marital terrorism meant to control their wives through instilling fear.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940622","headline":"Jerry Ball Joins the Silver and Black","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/22/sports/sports-people-football-jerry-ball-joins-the-silver-and-black.html","abstract":"  Defensive lineman JERRY BALL, a three-time Pro Bowler, signed with the Los Angeles Raiders yesterday.
