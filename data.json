Presented by Home for Contemporary Theater and Art, Randy Rollison, artistic director; Barbara Busachino, producing director. WITH: Chuck Coggins, Karen Levitas, Thomas Pasley and Lisa Welti.   There actually is no place like home in David Greenspan's \"Son of an Engineer,\" that is to say, home as a fixed institution doesn't exist. The story of a young man who returns to the suburban house of his childhood to discover his parents have \"moved on,\" this labored fable presents the nuclear family as a sinister disappearing act. And when a character turns on the radio, a voice announces, with comically frantic desperation, \"All these people come and go from our lives, and we don't know them anymore.\"   This is not very surprising news. Nor are the devices Mr. Greenspan employs -- a jumble of classic Albee-esque absurdism and imagery drawn from fairy tales, the Bible, Shakespeare, 1950's domestic sit-coms and apocalyptic science fiction -- particularly original.   As a result, \"Son of an Engineer,\" which has received a fairly skeletal production at the Here arts center in SoHo, often feels like a flat-footed, catch-all parody of vintage, symbol-laden avant-garde theater. It is unclear as to just how ironic Mr. Greenspan, who achieved a certain notoriety for his work with the New York Shakespeare Festival, is in his manipulation of this material. But there seems to be an agonizingly personal sense of anomie behind it.   The play's passive hero, identified only as the Killian Boy (Chuck Coggins), finds his old home inhabited by Tom (Thomas Pasley), a shaggy bear with a goofy, Disneyesque voice; Tom's wife, Phoebe (Karin Levitas), who dresses like Donna Reed and speaks with velvety ominousness; and Phoebe's mostly invisible daughter (Lisa Wells).   Directed with a cloudy mix of archness and anguished earnestness by Mr. Greenspan, \"Son of an Engineer\" includes a scene in which the naked son performs fellatio on the monstrously endowed paternal bear, while Phoebe ruefully washes her breasts in a Martian wilderness. It is that sort of evening.

They exist fully only in the moment of their performance. And to try to boil them down to synopsis or allegory is to make them sound both pretentious and slightly bogus.   Accordingly, to watch \"My Head Was a Sledgehammer,\" the most recent offering of Mr. Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theater, is to be swept into a dazzlingly self-contained, thoroughly exhilarating universe that seems in the viewing -- as does the best of Mr. Foreman's work -- logical, rational and disturbing in the way that individual dreams can be.

North, a Marine major, is assigned to the National Security Council at the White House.  DECEMBER President Ronald Reagan signs an executive order that authorizes a covert operation by the C.I.A. to support the contras, rebels who are fighting the leftist Government of Nicaragua. The Administration hopes its secret backing will bolster the contras' appearance as an indigenous independent force. 1982  DECEMBER With accounts of U.S. backing leaking out, Congress enacts the Boland Amendment, which bars the use of Federal money to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government. 1984  SPRING Major North is assigned as White House contact with the contras. 1985  FEBRUARY Through dummy corporations abroad, Colonel North and two associates -- Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general, and Albert A. Hakim, an Iranian-American arms dealer -- make the first of six purchases of weapons destined for the contras. The money comes from private contributions, all secret. By keeping the source of the money private, the White House is able to squeeze through a loophole in the Boland Amendment and maintain that this arms supply is legal.  SUMMER News accounts link Colonel North to a private network supplying military aid to the contras. The reports prompt questions from Congress, and Mr. North helps Robert C. McFarlane, the President's national security adviser, prepare a denial.  JULY Israeli Government officials, who long viewed Iran as a counterweight to Iraq and other Arab enemies of Israel, tell Mr. McFarlane that the Iranians want to open a \"political discourse\" with Washington. Although the United States publicly views the Teheran Government as terrorist and has outlawed arms sales to it, this overture soon leads to the first shipment of American weapons to Iran, without legal authorization. The shipment, in turn, brought the release of one of seven Americans held hostage in Lebanon by Islamic militants.  NOV. 19 Colonel North is appointed by Mr. McFarlane to handle logistics for a second arms shipment, of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, to Iran.  1986  APRIL 4 In a memo to John M. Poindexter, who has succeeded Mr. McFarlane as national security adviser, Colonel North proposes diverting to the contras $12 million of the proceeds from the sale to Iran. The memo, Colonel North will later testify, was intended for President Reagan.  MAY 25 Mr. McFarlane, who has formally left the Government but remains a consultant to the White House, flies secretly to Teheran with Colonel North and other officials, carrying spare parts for missiles.  AUG. 6 Meeting with 11 members of the House Intelligence Committee, Colonel North denies raising money for the contras or offering them military advice. As he later testified, this was a lie.  OCT. 5 Carrying arms to the contras, a cargo plane is shot down over Nicaragua. Three crewmen are killed, and a fourth, Eugene Hasenfus, is captured by the Nicaraguan Army.  NOV. 22 Justice Department investigators discover in Colonel North's office his April memo proposing the diversion of arms-sale money to the contras. NOV. 23 Colonel North meets privately with Mr. McFarlane and tells him that the diversion was approved by White House superiors. The colonel also meets with Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and informs him. NOV. 24 Mr. Meese tells the President of the diversion. NOV. 25 Mr. Meese discloses the Iran-contra connection. Mr. Reagan announces Mr. Poindexter's resignation and Colonel North's dismissal.  1987  JAN. 6-7 Special committees of the Senate and the House are created. FEB. 26A Presidential commission led by former Senator John G. Tower blames the President's top advisers for a chaotic environment that, the commission says, led to the Iran-contra affair. The panel says the President was largely out of touch with the operations of the N.S.C.  JULY 7 Appearing before the Congressional committees, Colonel North begins six days of frequently fervent testimony. He says that he does not know if Mr. Reagan was aware of the diversion of arms-sales money to the contras but that William J. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence, had approved it. Mr. Casey had recently died. NOV. 18 The Congressional committees conclude that the President failed to meet his constitutional mandate to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" The committees say that he bears \"ultimate responsibility.  1988  MARCH 11 Mr. McFarlane pleads guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding from Congress information about the Administration's efforts to help the contras. He is later sentenced to two years' probation and 200 hours of community service.  MARCH 16 A Federal grand jury indicts Colonel North, Mr. Poindexter, Mr. Secord and Mr. Hakim on an array of charges, among them conspiracy to defraud the Government by providing the contras with funds from Iran.  MARCH 18 Colonel North resigns from the Marine Corps.  1989  JAN. 5 The defense's demands for classified Government documents, and the Government's refusal to provide them, lead to the dropping of two central counts against Mr. North.  MAY 4 Mr. North is convicted of obstructing Congress, destroying documents and accepting an illegal gratuity. He is acquitted of nine counts.  JULY 25 The continuing battle over classified documents leads to the dropping of two of the most serious charges against Mr. Poindexter. NOV. 8 Mr. Secord pleads guilty to one count of making a false statement to Congress. The plea resolves all charges against him.  1990  APRIL 7 Mr. Poindexter is convicted of conspiracy to mislead Congress, obstructing Congressional inquiries and making false statements. JULY 20 A Federal appeals court sets aside the North conviction, ruling that the case may have been tainted by the testimony that Mr. North, under a grant of immunity, had given to the Congressional committees.  1991  JULY 9 Alan D. Fiers, former head of the C.I.A.'s Latin America task force, pleads guilty of withholding from Congress information about the arms-money diversion. He is later sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service. SEPT. 6 Clair E. George, former chief of covert operations for the C.I.A., is indicted on perjury charges. OCT. 7Elliott L. Abrams, former Assistant Secretary of State, pleads guilty of withholding information from Congress about efforts to aid the contras.

Mr. Halford, who writes all of Fight's songs, didn't change groups to try artistic experiments. Fight gears its music for commercial acceptance, giving every song a short, catchy chorus and keeping everything concise.    Like the final versions of Judas Priest, Fight plays stomping metal, at slow and fast tempos, to carry Mr. Halford's long-suffering words. There's some variety in the music, from the bluesy slide guitar of \"Little Crazy\" to the new-wave bounce of \"Vicious\" to the hard riffing of \"Contortion,\" but Fight doesn't flex formulas very far.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940119","headline":"Universities Turn to Computers to Lure Students","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/19/us/universities-turn-to-computers-to-lure-students.html","abstract":"  At a time of shrinking enrollment, some colleges are embracing new technology to market themselves better and to give students more information about their institutions.

It does not seek subtlety where none exists. With imagination, resourcefulness and right-on technical expertise, it successfully translates the concept of fortissimo from ear to eye. And after all, no one has ever accused Verdi's 26th opera of being chamber music.   Finely orchestrated, vocally grateful both for singer and listener and relentless in its dramatic progress, \"Aida\" certainly is. And there are its intermittent intimacies to admire as well. But from the brilliant trumpet writing of the Triumphal March to the love of wide leaps in the singing lines (the major seventh is a recurring interval), monumentality seems most on Verdi's mind.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940119","headline":"THE NEW YORK STATE BUDGET: An Eye on November; Budgets Have a Variety of Audiences: Voters of All Stripes and Bankers Too","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/19/nyregion/new-york-state-budget-eye-november-budgets-have-variety-audiences-voters-all.html","abstract":"  In an ideal election-year budget, a chief executive spreads largess far and wide, and the closer the money gets to the swing voters the better.

With the advent of music schools and the easy access to recordings, young musicians tend to gravitate to the same sources and the same ideas; idiosyncrasy is a long-forgotten notion. Von Freeman, the 71-year-old tenor saxophonist now at the Village Vanguard, is exactly that, idiosyncratic. He has lived in Chicago most of his life, and he sounds like it. His playing clearly has precedents, but in its distinctiveness, it can only have come from a place where jazz orthodoxy wasn't everything, where musicians had the time to experiment.   If the best jazz musicians have generally been able to muster the most resources, to bring the greatest rhetoric to bear on expression, then Mr. Freeman is a master. A solo of his, on up-tempo material, careens. He crams ideas into a short time then stops. The most noticeable element of his style is his manipulation of pitch, and he runs lines that seem to be paraphrasing some otherworldly harmony, dark sounds technically out of tune that slip quietly back into the normalcy of a tune's harmony. He pinches and squeezes notes, and lets them be soft for a minute, or hard for another. Sometimes he has notes run up his horn then lets squeals take over, howls that meander back into the realm of notes. And at times, he seems to be forcing three or four notes through his horn at once, a woolly mass that appears less as a pitch than just plain sound.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940120","headline":"Doing the Continental : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/20/opinion/IHT-doing-the-continental-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Let us imagine for one ghastly moment that guerrilla fighting erupts among French-speaking, English-speaking and Indian- speaking Canadians, which very soon spills over into \"ethnic cleansing.\" The United States calls on its European allies for","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940120","headline":"Knicks Ransack Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/20/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-ransack-mr-robinson-s-neighborhood.html","abstract":"  The outcome was no surprise.

It felt as if the audience was eavesdropping on Mr. Lupu's private fantasies.    At his best, Mr. Lupu, a Romanian who first attracted attention when he won the 1969 Leeds Piano Competition, is capable of this kind of nocturnal yet crisp playing. He doesn't really seem to care if anybody is listening; he is playing as if for himself, giving the music an unusual immediacy. Mr. Lupu's stage persona reinforces the impression of solitude.

The film that accomplishes this, Daniel Suter's \"Square of Light,\" comes from Switzerland and lasts less than five minutes. But with splaying crayon flashes, splats and swirls, synchronized with a soundtrack of thuds and crowd noises that vibrates with the dizzying sense of someone going in and out of consciousness, the film evokes brutal physical contact with a startling intimacy.   \"The Square of Light\" is one of several dazzling short films that make \"The 24th International Tournee of Animation,\" a 14-part survey of artists and styles, well worth a look. Like previous anthologies in the series, this one, which opens today at the Angelika Film Center in Greenwich Village, casts a wide stylistic net. You will find everything from latter-day descendants of \"The Flintstones\" and prehistoric cousins of the dinosaurs in \"Jurassic Park\" to a thoughtful Eastern European surrealism.

But you should always expect the unpredictable: the dislikable wife or sister shows a sudden warmth, the father who gave up drinking years ago goes on a bender, the mutinous children begin to forgive their parents. Pessimism is flavored with humor, and if most families are full of mine fields, the wounded usually offer bandages to one another.\n\nOzu died on his 60th birthday in 1963.

The plan, which had been rejected by the Dinkins administration, is a promising approach to boosting at least a few hundred people off the welfare rolls, with little risk of becoming a costly failure.   Under the contract the city will pay America Works, a New York corporation formed for this purpose, most of its $5,300 fee for placing a welfare recipient in private sector work for four months. The city will pay the balance only if the recipient keeps the job for at least seven months. Paying the full fee only for welfare recipients who succeed in holding permanent jobs distinguishes the program from other welfare-to-work experiments.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940121","headline":"Jury Begins Deliberating Bobbitt Mutilation Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/us/jury-begins-deliberating-bobbitt-mutilation-case.html","abstract":"  A jury began debating this afternoon whether Lorena L.

But many who have left private-sector lives of power, prestige and financial comfort in recent years only to face the ever more brutal costs of serving their country can empathize with the admiral's dilemma.    First, Government service has become largely reactive rather than creative. Political debate is sharper and commentary often personally vicious in the wake of such divisive issues as Vietnam, Watergate, the civil rights movement, the retreat into ethnocentrism and the multifaceted sexual revolution. Leaders who dare to take an unambiguous stand on key issues are often battered by intense media and interest group reactions, including ad hominem attacks, from which they never recover.

Yeltsin, American officials said they were still confident that reforms would continue to move apace, in part because Mr. Fyodorov was still in place.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940121","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/sports/results-plus-935719.html","abstract":"  N.B.A.  Double Time for Denver  Reggie Williams and Brian Williams hit baskets in the final minute of the second overtime last night, lifting Denver past the visiting Houston Rockets, 111-106, as the Nuggets snapped a four-game losing streak. Houston, losing its fourth in a row, rebounded from an 18-point first-quarter deficit to draw into a 92-92 tie at the end of regulation. The Rockets ran off 7 straight points early in the first overtime, but Denver countered with a 7-0 run of its own. A tip-in by Dikembe Mutombo with 11.6 seconds left made it 103-103, forcing a second extra session. After an exchange of turnovers and missed shots early in the second overtime, Mutombo hit a hook shot, and Reggie Williams followed with a layup on a pass from Brian Williams for a 107-103 advantage with 56 seconds left. (AP) Timberwolves 93, Spurs 83: Chris Smith and Thurl Bailey came off the bench to spark a 14-3 second-half run last night as the undermanned Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 93-83, in Minneapolis. Doug West scored 23 points for the Timberwolves. David Robinson returned to the Spurs' lineup after missing two games with soreness in his right knee and scored 25 points, but he missed 15 of 24 shots as San Antonio shot just 41 percent to Minnesota's 50 percent. The Timberwolves played without their top reserve, Chuck Person, who checked into a hospital earlier yesterday with an foot infection. (AP) GOLF  Broadcaster Plays, Too  Gary McCord, much better known in recent years as a golf broadcaster, was back in the playing mode yesterday and was one stroke out of the lead of the Northern Telco Open in Tucson. McCord shot a 7-under-par 65 to finish in a tie with Larry Nelson, one stroke behind Dillard Pruitt.   McCord said he plays a handful of tournaments early to sharpen up for his return to the broadcast booth. He said playing alongside the game's stars helps him keep from being critical on the air. \"Until you do that -- go down there with the adrenaline flying through -- there's no way to know about that,\" McCord said. \"It looks easy, because every time we see these guys on TV, they're shooting 64. They're teeing off late on Saturday and Sunday; they're all playing well, and pretty soon it looks like everybody should be playing well.\" (AP) YACHT RACING  Conner Now Trailing  The tables have turned on Dennis Conner and his Winston crew in the Whitbread Round the World Race. Having led the 14-boat fleet by as many as 147 miles during the 3,200-mile leg from Fremantle, Australia, to Auckland, New Zealand, Conner now finds himself fighting for third-place. Nine of the sailboats, including Winston, are expected to arrive in Auckland tomorrow. Six of the leading boats are bunched within 20 miles of one another. At the head of the pack are two New Zealand teams: Chris Dickson, skipper of the 60-foot Tokio, and Grant Dalton, skipper of the 80-foot maxi-yacht New Zealand Endeavour. About 165 miles behind Tokio, in seventh place among the 60-footers, was Heineken. Dawn Riley of Detroit took over the yacht when it was repossessed from Nance Frank. Formerly called U.S. Women's Challenge, the boat was renamed Heineken in Fremantle.

Long before \"Unforgiven\" made revisionist westerns trendy, Mr. Altman directed \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller,\" a lyrical and hardheaded masterpiece with Warren Beatty as a two-bit gambler and Julie Christie as a madam in a ramshackle mining town. The 1971 film only looks better with age. It will be playing through Feb. 3 (except Mondays) at Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street in the South Village.    The affecting McCabe wears a gold tooth and bowler hat to set him apart from the local riffraff. When he tells his mirror, \"I got poetry in my soul,\" he's almost believable. Mrs. Miller teaches him how to run a profitable house, and smokes opium to make her life bearable. In two of the best performances of their careers, Mr. Beatty and Ms. Christie play business partners and sexual partners who never quite admit they might also be lovers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940121","headline":"COUNSEL GRANTED A BROAD MANDATE IN CLINTON INQUIRY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/us/counsel-granted-a-broad-mandate-in-clinton-inquiry.html","abstract":"  The special prosecutor chosen to investigate President Clinton's Arkansas land dealings said today that he planned a broad inquiry that would include questioning the President and his wife, Hillary, under oath and an examination of any possible links to the suicide of a senior White House aide.
